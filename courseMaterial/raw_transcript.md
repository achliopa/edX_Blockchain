## Section 1 - Introduction to Blockchain

### Video 1 - What is Blockchain

There's a new technology that has the power to revolutionize how you, businesses, and the world interact!
You've probably heard of it: it's called Blockchain!
But what is it? How does it work? How does it affect you?
Hearing the word "blockchain" is comparable to hearing the word "internet" in the early 90s.
It seemed elusive, like something that wasn't going to impact your daily life.
But here we are, more than 20 years later. Think about how the Internet has transformed businesses, commerce, communication, even music and video.
And that's not even touching on how the Internet has affected you.
We all carry the Internet in our pocket.
We can transfer money at the touch of a button, check the weather, get directions, and even have food delivered to our door.
The next technology to have that kind of impact isn't some of the buzzwords you hear.
It's not big data. It's not artificial intelligence. It's not even social media.
It's BLOCKCHAIN!
Now, let's discuss the vast promise blockchain has for every business, every society, and for everyone listening today.
And let's begin with an example we are all familiar with.
When you attach a file, a Word document, an Excel sheet, a PDF to an email, you aren't sending an original.
You are actually sending the recipient a copy, and that's a great way to move information around.
But it's not so great when it comes to things like money, stocks and bonds, music, loyalty points, intellectual property, tickets to a game or concert.
Then, sending a copy is suddenly a very bad idea.
Let's look at an example.
If I send you tickets to a concert, it's important that I don't send you a copy.
You now own the original asset and I can no longer use or sell those tickets.
Similarly, if I send you $100, it's important that I still don't own the $100, or have the ability to send it to anyone else.
Both of these examples illustrate a double spend problem, and those can be eliminated with blockchain.
So now, in this exciting time in history, every kind of asset, from tickets, to money, to music, can be stored, moved, exchanged, and transacted without an intermediary.
People everywhere can transact peer-to-peer and trust each other by using collaboration and cryptography.
How did we get here, to this place of trust and collaboration?
It began when Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still unknown, released a white paper in 2008, introducing a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash known as Bitcoin.
It is here that blockchain technology made its debut.
Even today people believe Bitcoin and blockchain are one and the same.
They are not!
Bitcoin, another alternative currency,  utilize blockchain technology.
While an important one, Bitcoin is only one use case for blockchain.
Blockchain allows people to exchange assets and perform transactions without a third party.
Imagine a world where you don't need intermediaries.
While traditionally we have needed central authorities to trust one another and fulfill contracts,
blockchain makes it possible to have our peers guarantee that for us. But how?
Assets, like we've discussed, are no longer stored in a central place, but distributed across a global ledger, using the highest level of cryptography.
When a transaction is conducted, it's posted across tens of thousands of computers around the globe.
These transactions are recorded as blocks.
Let's imagine a sheet of paper that has 25 lines.
When a sheet is filled up with 25 transactions, the block is validated via group consensus.
Once the page has been validated, it is added to a stack of previously validated sheets.
Each sheet on the stack can be assumed to be trustworthy because, once a sheet is validated, it can't be changed.
Because at this point, all the sheets are linked together.
And to link our sheets together, we embed information from the previous sheet of paper into the new, recently validated sheet.
In blockchain, our sheet of paper is equal to a block.
The act of embedding a previous block of information into the current block of information is called chaining, hence, the name blockchain.
In order to compromise or hack a blockchain network, someone would have to gain control of the majority of computers in that network.
This is extremely difficult to do.
There is no longer a single point of failure, and this is what makes blockchain infinitely more secure than what we have today.
Blockchain isn't just for assets, though. It extends to contracts.
These are called Smart Contracts.
And what are they exactly? What they sound like.
A smart contract self-executes and handles enforcement, the management, and performance of agreements between people.
Examples of smart contracts include insurance policies, copyrighted content, escrow and lending, wills, and trusts.
Smart contracts will revolutionize how we do business.
There are so many possibilities with blockchain; not just in the now, but with things we haven't begun to think about yet.

## Section 2 - Basics of Blockchain

### Video 2 - Blockchain - Let's Cover the Basics

In this section, we're gonna talk about what blockchain is: a real simple introduction to the basic concepts and principles behind blockchain.
When you hear about blockchain, you probably think of new, high-emerging tech.
Well, really, all blockchain is, is a combination of technologies that have existed for a long time.
They're simply combined in a new and creative way to give us an amazing new platform on which we can start to build solutions.
Blockchains are often referred to as digital decentralized ledgers.
And when you think of that, all you can think of is something we're all familiar with: a simple notebook.
When we talk about blocks and blockchain, all we're really talking about is a page of data.
We fill up this page with any kind of data imaginable, and, while most of the time today, we're talking about recording financial transactions on this page, or this ledger, or this block,
we can record any kind of data we want.
In fact, you can think of a block as being exactly like this piece of paper, in that the paper doesn't know or care what kind of information you're recording on it.
And just like the paper doesn't know or care, neither does the block in a blockchain.
So, while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land titling, medical records, or even the opening notes to a Beethoven symphony.
What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that all the pages are linked together.
So that if I go back and try and change any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, I break a link in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way.
This gives blockchain a key property known as immutability.
And it's what gives blockchain the security that we've come to know and depend on.
Blockchains also give us an incredible technology called smart contracts,
which allow us to programmatically define the rules and steps that should be performed any time a certain type of event is recorded in our blockchain or in our magic notebook.
So, when you think about blockchain, don't get intimidated thinking it's something high tech, and new, and cutting-edge.
It's simply a new and creative way of combining old ideas together to give us an incredible new solutions platform.
And the rest of this series will take a deeper dive into these basic concepts and principles,
but if the idea of this unchangeable linked notebook makes sense, congratulations!
You already understand all the major principles and concepts required to understand what blockchain is and why it's so powerful.

### Video 3 - Introduction to Blockchain Components

* In this section, we're going to discuss the core components of the blockchain, starting with a high-level view of the blockchain components.
The first blockchain component that we're going to look at it's the ledger.
However, before we discuss the ledger, let's discuss briefly the history of the ledger.
The story of blockchain is tightly coupled with the story of accounting.
Historically, humans started off with no way to prove ownership and we began with a single entry accounting system.
The single entry accounting system for the first time in human history allowed us to prove ownership of the asset.
The ledger was associated with an owner.
The single entry accounting worked for centuries.
The issue with single entry accounting is that it mandated that there was a single authority, which is the reason why there was the necessity for a king or a queen to control the ledger.
In order to have trade, right, at the international level, we needed to have at least two authorities.
So, for instance, for England to do trade with France, we had the owner of the ledger, the single entry ledger, in England for instance, doing trade with the king or queen of France, who also had their ledger.
And so, we needed a new form of accounting, and that's where double entry accounting came in, which was in use up until very recently, now, within the last 40 years.
What blockchain is? Blockchain is the very first implementation of triple entry accounting, where we have an asset being recorded on the ledger in the context of a transaction.
The third entry and triple entry accounting is cryptography, where we have a cryptographic account of the transaction stored permanently and immutably on the ledger.
That's what the ledger is. A ledger is a collection of transactions.
It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction.
In blockchain, the differentiator is that no one owns the ledger, or all of the participants own the ledger.
The ledger is distributed. It is, in other words, it's decentralized. So, there's a copy of the ledger that exists on every node that exists on the network.
Said simply, the ledger is a distributed immutable record of a collection of transactions.
Bitcoin is the most popular asset.
It was the first asset to be recorded as a transaction on a blockchain ledger, and it remains the most popular, at least in terms of market share.
That's what the ledger is.
As we move to more modern blockchains, we start to look at blockchains such as Ethereum, which not only records the asset on the blockchain,
Ethereum and other public blockchains like Ethereum, they also allow you to have a permanent and immutable collection of code, also known as a smart contract, that runs on the blockchain.
So, the ledger stores the assets, the transactions that are on the blockchain, and it also holds the code.
The code that's stored on the blockchain is a smart contract.
Again, a smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain.
The blockchain is a network.
The blockchain is a ... A public blockchain is equivalent to the Internet, complete with the its own set of protocols, etc.
Private blockchains are more synonymous with an intranet.
It is... just like we have a use case for public blockchains and public internet, we also have use cases for private blockchains and an intranet, if we're gonna stay with that analogy.
On each of these networks there are nodes. The nodes are going to be synonymous with the computers that make up the network.
On the nodes, they are put together by a collection of protocols.
Each blockchain has its own set of protocols that defines not only the nodes, but how those nodes communicate with each other.
So, when you hear the term "peer network", that's what we're talking about;
we're talking about how that blockchain is put together, what are the protocols that define the peers, and how those peers interact.
Those peer networks, they store the ledger, they provide the updates, they effectively, they maintain the ledger.
That's what a peer is on a peer network.
On a public blockchain, it's public, and, by definition, that means that anyone is allowed to join and participate in that public blockchain.
On the private blockchain, however, the situation is a little different.
On the private blockchain, we have to control who can access your network.
Just like no company would allow... no company would allow anyone to access their private intranet,
in a private blockchain you have to be asked to join, or you have to have permission to join.
So, a membership service is a gateway that allows users and components to enter a private blockchain.
So, a membership service or a membership service provider provides the services of user authentication,
user authorization, component authentication, component authorization, more specifically Identity Management.
If we're talking about a private blockchain, then we have to control who the members are, and not only the members.
We have to also control the nodes that access the blockchain.
So, as we're talking about membership, one of the key components of membership is we have to allow certain users to access the blockchain.
In order to do that, we have to have a definitive identity for each user.
In the blockchain, that's achieved in two ways.
One, we use PKI, to provide a public key. And that public key represents the identity of the user.
But we also need a private key that each user can hold to prove their identity.
That private key is stored in a wallet. And a wallet is a collection of the user credentials. It is effectively ... it encapsulates private keys.
Additionally, in the blockchain... blockchains are self-contained, or they should be self-contained.
And so, one of the key aspects for developing on a blockchain or using a blockchain is we have to have a way to interact with the blockchain.
And one of the ways that we do that is through events.
So, when something occurs on the blockchain, either public blockchains... most public blockchains anyway, and certainly all private blockchains,
they have events that are fired when certain key actions are triggered.
This allows end-users, other systems, other users, different components to be able to act off of the events that come from an update on a blockchain.

### Video 4 - Who Is Using Blockchain?

There are a lot of really interesting use cases being explored with blockchain right now.
When you first get into blockchain, one of the areas you'll see people immediately jump to are healthcare, how can we manage our personal health information on the blockchain, and voting an election reform,
and both of these are really, really interesting ideas.
The goal behind the folks looking at blockchain for healthcare is the idea that it would be great if your medical records could be accessible with your permission to anyone else, anywhere on the planet.
So, if you're halfway across the world on vacation and you fall ill and end up in a hospital, wouldn't it be great if the doctor treating you had full insight into your medical records,
knew any allergies you had, or knew any prescriptions that you were already on?
So, that's a very, very big area, and this ties a lot into blockchain and Identity Management.
How do we safely identify and protect people's personal data on blockchain?
So, a lot of interesting challenges there that are being worked out...
Blockchain for voting and election reform is a big topic right now,
especially with all the conversation lately about how do we ensure the integrity of elections and demonstrate that our results haven't been tampered with or altered.
This is an area where blockchain could add a lot of value.
And then, of course, we hear a lot about traditional use cases, areas that are getting a lot of traction in blockchain right now.
Probably one of the biggest are supply chain, value chain relationships, which are very, very common in today's economy.
We have very, very few products or services that are offered completely and solely by one organization, without the involvement of other vendors, partners, suppliers, manufacturers, third-party organizations, etc.
So, blockchain to track the supply, the origin of the goods and services that we consume is a big use case.
Walmart is really pioneering this right now with a blockchain solution that they're using to identify the provenance of meat,
where does the meat that is sold in a Walmart store come from, and the ultimate goal here is that, when we do have contaminated foods, and we have to issue a recall,
currently, because we just don't have good insight into that supply chain, we recall and destroy a lot more food than we really need to,
which is tremendously wasteful, especially with all the people on the planet that we could be giving that good food to.
So, these are some real, real exciting areas that we see being pursued in blockchain right now.
On the public sector, there's a lot of interest in blockchain for law enforcement purposes.
How do we allow different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, county, city level, all to share data seamlessly, in a safe, secure fashion,
which also protects people's personal privacy and anonymity, when appropriate.
Another area where blockchain is getting explored and is generating a lot of excitement is with artists, with people who produce content.
So, if you're an author, if you're a musician, if you're an artist,
traditionally, you've only been able to get your work out to the public, in the hands of the public, by going through a third-party intermediary.
So, if I'm an author, traditionally, the only way I've been able to share my creation with the general public has been going to a publishing company and getting my works published.
Blockchain enables lots of interesting scenarios where I can sell that work directly to consumers, create new subscription models,
and this is having very interesting effects on the work itself.
One of the things we're seeing is that traditional book publishing, there's anywhere between 12 to 18 months delay between when the author finishes the last word of a book and when it actually ends up into the consumers hands.
Well, if we can use blockchain to enable consumers to purchase this material or subscribe directly to the content creator, we take that lag time completely out of it.
And this allows authors and content creators to do some really interesting things.
You could write a fictional story and have one of your characters respond real-time to a news story that actually happened last week.
It makes for very compelling reading and it's just something we're not able to do today in the traditional publishing world because of that delay.
We also see a lot of interest in blockchain for fractional asset ownership scenarios.
So, we know we're 10-15 years away from having self-driving cars be a very regular thing, and when we all get our own self-driving car, if we're smart,
we're gonna have that car take us to work and then turn around and perform ride-sharing services throughout the day, when we're not using it, in order to recoup some of that investment.
Well, in a blockchain world with coins and tokens, we can fractionalize that asset ownership,
and I can take that same money I used to buy one self-driving car which operates in one city,
and I could buy one percent of a hundred self-driving cars in the hundred's biggest cities on the planet.
And so, if they're ever weather conditions, where maybe my car couldn't operate locally, that's okay.
I have a much more diversified investment, which continues to offer returns,
because I have a virtual guarantee that any major city that I have one percent of my car ownership in is currently in rush-hour right now, in peak times of people needing a ride.
So, there are lots of very very interesting use cases for blockchain in the real world right now.
I would encourage all of you to dig in a little bit more,
and see some of the interesting things that are going on with blockchain in healthcare, in public sector, in insurance, in supply chain, value chain and more,
see what other folks are doing, and then go out and make your own blockchain dreams a reality.

### Video 5 - Dubai Use Case

So, when people first start getting into blockchain, one of the areas they really start to look at is where is blockchain being used in the real world,
what examples do we have of a blockchain being deployed and at what scale.
And there's really no better example of this right now than what's going on in Dubai.
Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is piloting a very ambitious program called smart Dubai 2021.
And what Smart Dubai 2021 aims to do is to move all governmental operations and record-keeping on the blockchain by the year 2021.
The goals of this program are increased transparency in the government operations, increased efficiency,
and by proxy, providing better service to city residents and constituents and establishing Dubai as a thought leader, an industry leader in the blockchain space.
There are lots of really cool applications that tie into this.
Blockchain is becoming the enabling layer for a lot of other Smart Dubai initiatives around creating a smart city.
So, projects like automated traffic signals, registration of citizens for governmental services, etc. are all being pioneered on blockchain.
So, if you want to see some of the really exciting use cases in blockchain right now, be sure to check out Dubai and what's going on with their Smart Dubai 2021 initiative.

## Section 3 - Distributed Ledgers

### Video 6 - Island of Yap

The concept of distributed ledge's has been around for hundreds of years.
To understand the basics of blockchain, it's important to understand how distributed ledgers work.
A distributed ledger is a collection of data with no central administrator that has been agreed upon by consensus.
To understand more details, let's take a trip way back, back into 500 AD on the island of Yap.
The Yapese people used a very unique form of currency: the Rai stone.
Each of these stones weighed around 200 kilos, making them difficult to move.
To exchange them as money for goods or services, they divided the stones into sections and then, they would announce to every adult on the island who owned what part of each stone.
Each adult had to keep a mental ledger of ownership.
Every time any Yapese conducted a trade, an announcement was made to the entire tribe.
Each member of the tribe would then update their mental ledger.
In today's description, this would be called a distributed ledger.
All Rai stone ownership was known to everyone, and that knowledge was updated whenever a transaction was made.
So why didn't just one member of the tribe keep track of the Rai stones?
What if that main recordkeeper was sick, unable to do their job, or was found to be dishonest?
If the only copy of the ledger was changed by any means, wealth would be lost or gained unfairly.
The Yapese knew their distributed ledger system safeguarded it from tampering.
Since all the Yapese knew who owned what, it would be very difficult to fool everyone on the island.
Even if one tribe member moved away, the tribe still had multiple copies of their mental ledger.
In this regard, the ledger was fault tolerant and could not be easily changed, corrupted, or lost.
The tribe also decided that stones didn't have to be on the island to hold value.
One day, a stone fell into the ocean and the Yapese decided that this stone, even though it could not be seen, still held value and could still be traded.
This system of consensus by the majority of the adults on the island with no central administrator is one of the first examples of distributed ledger.

### Video 7 - The Evolution of Distributed Ledgers

We've gone through history and seen how ledgers have evolved from stone tablets to double entry ledgers.
We even took a look at the earliest known example of distributed ledgers.
Now, let's discuss the evolution of the ledger in the modern world.
Over the last few decades, ledgers have moved from the written form to the digital form, also known as computers and digitalized databases.
This has allowed us to be interconnected - a truly global economy.
Today, this recordkeeping system is being revolutionized again,
going from the digital realm or centralized databases keeping track of transactions to information being stored across different locations across the globe.
This system of record, information across a global network, is what we call decentralized ledgers.
A decentralized ledger can be described as a ledger of any transactions or contracts supported by a decentralized network from across different locations and people, eliminating the need of a central authority.
When a recording is made, every participant is notified of that recording.
They now own an identical copy of the record of transactions, identical to every other node on that network.
Every piece of information on a blockchain can be traced back to the exact moment when it was created.
So, if an audit is necessary, information can be found and deemed reliable.
This allows blockchain to serve as a truly reliable storage of public records and transactions, and therefore eliminating the need for a centralized authority of database of records.
Now that we understand the foundational principle of blockchains - distributed ledgers, it's important to understand another important key element that makes blockchain so revolutionary: trust.
Trust is created through two key principles: collaboration and cryptography, both of which will be discussed shortly.

### Section 4 - Cryptography

### Video 8 - From Distributed Ledger to Cryptography

A great way to think of blockchain is to think of blockchain as another layer of  the Internet, a layer that enables secure and trusted records and transactions to occur,
which is why a lot of people associate the word blockchain with the  word trust.
Blockchain creates a layer of trust between untrusted parties.
Without blockchain to create trusted records and transactions, a third party intermediary is necessary.
Blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized institution to act as intermediary, and instead uses cryptography and collaboration to create that trust.
In an earlier chapter of this course we spoke about collaboration through distributed ledgers.
Now, we will be taking a further look at how cryptography is used in blockchain to create the second element necessary for blockchain to be a source of trust.
Information on the blockchain is stored on the ledger using cryptography.
It can be accessed using keys and cryptographic signatures.
Now, let's take a look into some of the key concepts of cryptography that are utilized with blockchain.

### Video 9 - Rose Greenhow

So, one of the reoccurring themes in blockchain is that while blockchain itself may be new and cutting-edge, it's built out of nothing more than very old tried-and-true technology.
And one of the areas this is most true is in cryptography.
When a lot of people first get introduced to cryptography they think it's a very new cutting-edge science.
And while there are new developments being made everyday, cryptography itself is a very, very old science.
One great example of this is the story of Rose Greenhow.
Rose Greenhow lived in the Washington DC area during the Civil War, and she was actually an undercover spy for the Confederate Army.
Rose Greenhow was a wealthy socialite, and she threw many fancy, elaborate parties, and was also invited to many, many high-end social events.
Many of these events were attended by members of the Union Army, generals and strategists, who Rose pretended that she didn't know much about military strategy and wasn't too interested in the war in general.
In secret, at all these events she was soaking up all the information she could.
Rose actually developed her own method of encrypting data.
She came up with her own encryption scheme and she used this scheme to mail letters down to the Confederate Army, revealing the plans of the Union Army, troop positions, general high-level strategy, etc.
Rose did this for a number of years, until finally her encryption method was broken and she was actually one of the very first people who were arrested and prosecuted by the Pinkertons,
who later went on to form the Secret Service.
So, when you hear about blockchain and all the new cutting-edge things that it's doing, don't forget that it has its roots in very old technology,
and we're just combining old technology in new and creative ways to create a brand new solutions development platform.

### Video 10 - Cryptography Basics

So, one of the technologies that plays a pivotal role in blockchain and making blockchain secure and immutable is cryptography.
If you've never heard of cryptography before, cryptography is simply designed defined as the science of sending messages back and forth from one party to another,
in the presence of adversaries or bad actors, participants who may wish to corrupt or change the contents of a message.
And there's some key concepts you should understand about cryptography before we really dive in and talk about how cryptography protects the data on the blockchain.
Most cryptographic functions are what we refer to as two-way functions,
meaning that we can take a secret and we can encrypt it, and then we can use that same process to decrypt the secret at the other end.
So, some of the key objects or concepts to be aware of in cryptography:
first of all are the secret, what data are we trying to protect, what is the message we're sending back and forth that we want to do so in a safe, secure fashion,
and try and guarantee that it hasn't been tampered with.
We take our secret and we combine it with a key, a piece of data that is consumed by a function, our third component.
When the function receives the key and the secret, the function uses the key to change the data in the secret,
to create the fourth and final component, which is known as the cipher.
And the cipher is simply the encrypted message, the thing that, if it were intercepted, if it were seen by anybody else, any non-participants or bad actors,
they wouldn't know what the secret was, they wouldn't know what the message was, and they wouldn't know how to decrypt that cipher back into the secret.
Now again, most cryptographic functions are two-way, meaning it doesn't do me a lot of good to encrypt data if the receiving party at the other end can't decrypt it.
And oftentimes, all this involves is using the same key or a reverse key into the same function, with the cipher's input to get the secret back out.
So, when we talk about cryptography, keep in mind those four basic components: the secret, the key, the function, and the cipher.
Then, understand that cryptographic hashing is a very special class of cryptographic functions,
which, unlike all their cousins, are only one way,
meaning that in a cryptographic hash I can put information or a secret into it,
the key and the function are contained as one entity, and what I get back out is encoded data.
I get what's called a hash or a hash result, that is an encryption based on the data that I put in.
That is mathematically impossible to reverse-engineer and this is what makes it a one-way function.
If you put any data into a cryptographic hash and you share that hash with me,
there's absolutely nothing I can do above and beyond random guessing to try and recreate that input to tell me what your original secret was.
Cryptographic hashes are used in scenarios where we want to prove a piece of data without sharing that data.
So, password management systems use this all the time.
We don't want to store a username and password, we want to store a username and the hash output of a password.
That way, I don't know what any of my users' passwords are, but I do know that if they put the wrong password in,
they're going to get the wrong hash back out, and I can easily validate that a user's password is correct or incorrect, without having to know what it is.
We're gonna dive in a lot deeper in a later module, to show you exactly through a demo how cryptographic hashing works,
and how it provides security and immutability on the blockchain.
But just understand these two big takeaways:
Number one, that cryptography is normally a two-way function with four components: the secret, the key, the function, and the cipher,
and then finally, there are a subclass of cryptographic functions called cryptographic hash functions,
which exist as one-way functions, which can only encrypt the secret,
and again, which are mathematically impossible to decrypt the secret in any other method other than randomly guessing input until you're able to recreate that hash output.
These are key components which enable security and immutability on the blockchain.

### Video 11 - Byzantine Fault Tolerance

As you start to get more and more into blockchain, one term that you're gonna hear a lot is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
And if you're wondering what that means, that very strange, cryptic sounding term, that can be explained with a story.
In 1982, a mathematical problem was formulated called the Byzantine Generals Problem,
and without getting too detailed into the mathematics behind it,
essentially, with the Byzantine Generals Problem was a story about two empires fighting a battle.
One Empire exists within the confines of a walled city, the second Empire has several generals surrounding that walled city, each with their armies waiting to attack.
And the balance of power is very, very evenly matched between these two empires.
And it is such that if all the generals agree to attack at the same time, they will have enough power to overcome the empire in the city and win the campaign.
If they, for whatever reason, they're not able to coordinate their attacks simultaneously, and even one general misses the message,
well then, the Empire surrounding the walled city is going to lose the campaign and the war.
So, the Byzantine Generals Problem explored a really key area of cryptography, in fact, the heart of what cryptography is,
which is how do I exchange messages with someone in an environment where they may become corrupt.
You have to understand the only way these generals had to communicate was to send a disguised messenger through the city with a message to deliver to the other generals,
and so, this always posed the risk, if you're a general and you're getting amessage from one of these messengers,
how do you know or how can you believe with greater than random certainty that the message you're getting is reliable and it hasn't been tampered with.
And this, again, was a problem that was postulated back in 1982 and went unsolved until 2008,
when the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a solution to this problem.
Essentially, what the solution entails is all of the generals hiring as many mathematicians as they can.
When we talk about Byzantine Fault Tolerance, we're talking about the generals having more access, having more mathematicians, or more computing power on their side than the empire within the city.
So, if I'm the generals and I can hire more mathematicians, then that means that I can encrypt my messages going through the city with greater and greater complexity,
and if the balance of power becomes greatly tipped in the favor of the generals outside the city,
they can use encryption methods which are so complex, that there really is no real chance, or a very small chance that any of the mathematicians inside the city will be able to intercept that message,
decrypt it, change the contents, re-encrypt it, and do so in a time quick enough that the generals don't notice anything has happened.
And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
This is the fault tolerance mechanism that we see used in most public blockchain solutions right now,
including Bitcoin, including Ethereum, although Ethereum is working on transitioning to a system called Proof of Stake, which we'll talk about in a later section.
But, when you hear Byzantine Fault Tolerance, often abbreviated as BFT,
all we're talking about is this idea that blockchains become secure if they have more computing power, more hash power in the chain than off the chain.
So, solutions like Ethereum, 16,000 plus nodes, or Bitcoin, the largest blockchain network that there is, with over 30,000 nodes,
offer us a high degree of security and immutability,
because the computing power on those networks is so great that there's really no reasonable chance that an adversary could ever control as much or more computing power to attack the data on that blockchain.
And if someone ever were to, chances are the economics behind it would be such that they would spend more to simultaneously harness all that computing power,
than they could possibly stand to gain.
And so, this is Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
It is the root of cryptography, which is simply the study of how do we send information back and forth securely in the presence of adversaries and bad actors,
and it's what underlies all the security and immutability that we get in blockchain.

### Video 12 - Private/Public Key Cryptography

So, I want to talk a little bit about cryptography and some cryptography principles.
The first is easy and hard problems, and this is really what public - private key cryptography is based off of.
There are some problems that are very easy one way, but difficult another way.
And a great example of this is multiplication.
So, if I give you a pen and paper and a lot of time, I can ask you to multiply any two numbers,
and you can probably come up with an answer fairly easily.
What's a lot more difficult is if I give you the product of two numbers and ask you to factor that and find out all the numbers you can multiply together to get that result, that's a much harder problem.
This is how public - private key cryptography works.
We use an easy mathematical problem to generate a message, but we make it very, very hard for that message to be decrypted by someone who shouldn't decrypt it,
and public and private keys play a big role in blockchain.
I want to show you right now.
I've got two different wallets. I've got a wallet that you're probably used to, that you keep money in,
and then I've got a hardware wallet, a digital wallet that you'd use to trade something like bitcoin or ether.
Now, what you're used to, in your regular wallet, is putting money in here and you keep your money in here, and if you lose this, whoever finds it gets your money and they get to spend it.
In blockchain, with cryptocurrencies, it's a little bit different.
The only thing that ever gets kept in here is your private key.
And a private key - public key work together so that I can use a private key to sign, digitally sign, any message.
You can then take the public key, which anyone can know, and use that to verify that my specific private key was the one that actually signed that message.
And so, you can know without a doubt that I'm the one who created that message,
that no one was pretending to be me sending this message.
And this is how it works trading digital currencies back and forth.
If I decide I'm going to pay you three bitcoins and I'm gonna do it out of this hardware wallet or any software wallet, any kind of digital currency,
the only thing that's kept on this device is my private key and it never leaves,
and so, that means if I want to send you some money, all I'm doing is accessing the private key on this device to sign a message that gets transmitted to the blockchain,
that says I'm paying you some bitcoin or some ether or some litecoin,
and my public key is used to verify that that message actually did come from the wallet that says it did.
And this is how we trade cryptocurrencies back and forth,
and that's what makes the concept of a digital wallet a little bit different.
If I happen to lose this, I haven't lost the money that's in it, because there's no money ever in it.
All that money is is just a record on the blockchain, and, as long as I can recover that private key somehow, I can just get a new device,
start using my private key again and keep right on trading.
So, that's how public and private keys fit into blockchain; a very key component just to understand that they're used to sign and verify any transactions that you make.

### Video 13 - Zero-Knowledge Proof - Cave Example

In this section, we're going to talk about a cybersecurity idea in blockchain known as "Zero-Knowledge Proofs".
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are exactly what the name implies - they allow me to prove to another party that I have a certain piece of knowledge without revealing what that knowledge is.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are often referred to as zk-SNARKs, which stand for "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge", or zk-SNARKs for short,
or, if you want to be simple, we can just call them Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
A great example of a Zero-Knowledge Proof is what we call the cave door analogy.
Pretend that there's a circular cave, with only one entrance or exit and at the back of this circular cave there's a door which can be unlocked using a secret code entered onto a keypad.
If I want to prove to you that I know the unlock code without revealing that unlock code to you,
all I need to show is that I can walk into one end of the cave, open the door, and come out the other end.
If I've successfully demonstrated that, then you know without a doubt I've been able to unlock that door,
but yet I haven't revealed that unlock code to you.
This simple cave door analogy is a Zero-Knowledge proof, and if you can remember this cave door analogy,
then you'll understand why Zero-Knowledge Proofs are so important in blockchain.
For example, a user may make a request to send another user some money.
The blockchain naturally wants to make sure, before it commits this transaction,
that the user sending the money has enough to send.
However, the blockchain doesn't really need to know or care who is spending the money, or how much total money they have.
Being able to answer a question of "Does a user have enough money to send to another user" without knowing who the user is, or exactly how much they have,
is one of the primary use cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in blockchain.
So, when you hear about zk-SNARKs, don't get intimidated.
It's not a complex idea. Just think of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and the cave door,
think about how important it is in blockchain to be able to prove a claim without actually revealing the information behind that claim,
and you'll understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

### Video 14 - Cryptographic Hashing Demo

In this section, we're going to talk about cryptographic hashing.
A cryptographic hash is a special kind of cryptographic function known as a one-way function,
whereas most cryptographic functions are two-way, meaning that data cannot only be encrypted, but can be decrypted at the other end.
Hashes, or cryptographic hashes, are very unique in that once data is encoded, it can never be decoded.
Let's look at a small example of this.
If we take a simple sentence, "Let's eat, grandma!", this input sentence will generate a unique 32-character hash output.
This hash output can be thought of as an identifier for this input data.
In other words, I can input this data into a hash function to generate this output, and I can share this output with anybody, anywhere,
safe in the knowledge that it is mathematically impossible for anyone to reverse-engineer the original input from this hash output.
In fact, the only possible way that anybody could ever determine what this input was,
was by randomly inputting data into a hash function until they were able to recreate the same output.
Another unique function of a cryptographic hash is that any small change to a dataset, no matter how small,
will result in an entirely different hash.
If I remove the comma from this sentence, not only do I entirely change the meaning of the sentence,
I also generate a new 32-character hash output.
This 32 character hash output remains a fixed length no matter how big the input dataset is.
To demonstrate this, let's take the entire first book of Tolstoy's War and Peace, and paste it into our hash function.
You'll see that the most time-consuming part of this is not generating the hash,
but simply moving all the data from the clipboard into the input text box.
I've generated a unique 32-character output or identifier for this input text.
You'll notice that this is the same length hash that I got when I had a short one sentence input,
and if I change anything in this extremely large dataset, even one character, I will generate an entirely new hash output.
Let's take a look at this by removing the period at the end of this sentence, and replacing it with a question mark.
You'll see that by doing so, I've generated a completely different and unique 32-character hash output.
Hash functions not only play a critical role in blockchain security by enabling blocks to be linked together in creating immutability between data on the blocks,
they can also be used as a great way to identify and verify large sources of data.
Let's look at some other use cases.
If I want to build a system which authenticates users, but I don't want to store their password directly in a database where it might be stolen or corrupted,
a hash function can be a great solution.
Let's say I have a very simple password, password123, but I don't want to store that password inside my authentication database.
I can simply ask the user to type in their password and store the hash output from that password.
Any subsequent time a user tries to log on, I don't need to know their password. I just need to verify that they're able to recreate this hash output.
If they can't do that, because they have the wrong password, then I can simply choose not to authenticate them into my system.
Cryptographic hashes can also be used to validate source code or real large datasets in the real world.
Let's look at self-driving cars for an example.
Let's say we've developed a self-driving car with the intelligence to hash the source code every time it starts up.
My self-driving car, every time I start the car, can take its source code, run it through a hash and generate a unique identifier.
It can then share this identifier or 32-character hash output with every other self-driving car it has contact with,
or even validate this against a database or some other centralized data store, or perhaps an immutable record on the blockchain.
This gives me the confidence that if the source code for my self-driving car ever gets hacked and makes it unsafe to drive,
I'll know it right away. I'll try to start my self-driving car, which will immediately hash its source code,
share that hash output with other self-driving cars or validate it against an authoritative source,
and instantly we can see I've got an entirely different hash output letting me know before I've gone anywhere
that my self-driving car is not safe, and putting that self-driving car into a limp or shutdown mode,
where it simply refuses to go anywhere until the compromised software has been updated and replaced with the right version.
Cryptographic hashes give us a way to link all blocks on the blockchain together in an immutable fashion,
such that if any one particular block or the data on any block is changed or altered to any degree, no matter how small,
we will know it instantly and we will break the link between that block and every subsequent block.
If you haven't watched the module in this course that covers the in-depth walkthrough of Proof of Work consensus,
you might want to check it out now.
We actually show how cryptographic hashing is used to link together all blocks on the blockchain,
creating a data store that is immutable, secure, and extremely trustworthy.

### Video 15 - Merkle Tree, Validation of Data

Blockchains use Merkle trees for fast and efficient validation of data.
Merkle trees summarize the entire set of data in a block by creating a root hash of that data.
A root hash is created by repeatedly hashing pairs of child nodes until only one node is left.
Let's take a look at a diagram of a Merkle tree.
This diagram consists of four transactions represented as transaction "A", transaction "B", "C" and "D".
The transaction data is then hashed and the resulting hashes are stored in leaf nodes represented as H of "A", "B", "C" and "D".
Nodes are repeatedly hashed in pairs and the resulting hashes are stored in child nodes until only one node remains: the Merkle root or root hash.
The reason you wouldn't want to hash the entire set of data as a string is because it's not efficient when validating transactions.
In this example, if Alice needed to show Bob that this transaction was valid, let's say transaction "C", Alice would need to send the entire list of data to validate the block.
But when using a Merkle tree, Alice only needs to send the nodes that contain the transaction that she is looking to validate.
Let's say Alice wants to validate transaction "F".
Alice would only need to send the data of transaction "F" and four hash values to Bob.
Bob would then calculate the hash value based on the given information.
And if the root matches the block, the transaction can be assumed to be valid.
Merkle trees allow for validation of a specific transaction without requiring the entire set of data.

## Section 5 - Transparency

### Video 16 - Disintermediation - Trust Through Transparency

Now, that we have an understanding of how collaboration and cryptography work together to create a layer of trust,
let's discuss how blockchain has a powerful disintermediation effect.
Nodes on the network are allowed to place data directly onto the database that is shared.
This eliminates the need for an intermediary to do such task.
As we discussed, developers can create a distributed ledger on a blockchain,
and use cryptography to give people secure storage space on that ledger.
This creates a very different world than what we have come to know today,
because for the first time in the digital world, people are allowed to own their own data.
You may be asking yourself: "How is this different from the current technology?".
Today, organizations use our data, sell our data, store our data, and exchange our data.
Data is an extremely powerful asset and to own your own data is a vast change to the current system.
In a world powered by blockchain, having ownership of your database is truly empowering.
You can now share the information that you choose with any organization that you desire.
The power of blockchain and owning your own data is the ability to transact peer-to-peer.
With the current system of intermediaries, when you go out to eat at a restaurant,
and you pay with your credit or debit card, you're not paying the restaurant directly.
Instead, a database record at your bank is being debited and the database record at their bank is being credited.
In this example, the value and data in the database belong to the intermediary, and not the individual.
You are then dependent upon them to secure and validate your transaction, which shifts the power to the intermediary.
But in a blockchain world, the individual has their own ledger record,
and the secure key that allows them to access it.
You no longer need an intermediary.
A transaction is simply debited from your record and credited directly to somebody else's record.
Blockchain allows you to have the power to control more than financial transactions.
Later, we'll take a deeper dive into how the healthcare industry may utilize blockchain to allow people to own their own health records.
And with blockchain, you can determine who can access those records.
We talked about how cryptography and collaboration create trust.
Now, let's examine how peer-to-peer transactions with blockchain create transparency which can lead to even another layer of trust.
This layer of trust can aid to curb corruption and even create cost savings.
Currently, the data and records owned at centralized organizations are stored and hidden within a database.
These databases for the most part are inaccessible and do not communicate in an effective manner with other systems.
This also makes it easier for a corrupt individual or persons within the centralized organization to manipulate these records.
Because of the possibility for manipulation and foul play, there are many flawed and expensive safeguards put into place.
These safeguards are done through regulations and legal requirements creating expensive overhead and delays.
Besides the mounting cost to safeguard these internally, there are also many necessary safeguards from external forces,
because they are individual points of critical data storage, bad actors have to identify only one point of failure to access.
The combination of one central point of storage and the storage of valuable data make these centralized databases a very enticing target for malicious persons.
With blockchain, these malicious actors would have to identify and target numerous points of failure until they control more than 51% or what's known as consensus.
In most blockchains, it could be up to hundreds of thousands of points of weakness that would have to be exposed to be corrupted.
It's nearly an insurmountable task.
Not only must a centralized organization worry about bad actors, but they must do so, while still allowing access and synchronizing with other centralized organizations.
Having to constantly update and synchronize data across many centralized databases is not efficient.
The cost is high and the vulnerability to bad actors is amplified.
All the more reason blockchain solutions are so exciting.
Blockchain offers efficiency. It also creates trust and financial benefit through transparency, security, immutability, and accessibility through ownership.

### Video 17 - Transparency

One of the big benefits we get in any blockchain solution, public or private, is the idea of transparency.
In a public blockchain solution like Bitcoin or Ethereum, because they're anonymous and we have no concept of identity, we have no way of treating users differently.
And so all data on a public blockchain is transparent and visible to all other participants.
And this is really important. It adds a lot of value, when we're talking about exchanging currency or tokens of monetary value,
because as long as we can protect the anonymity of the participants, it gives us a great way for anybody to validate the details of any transaction on a ledger
that is immutable, permanent, can't be changed and offers a high degree of trust.
This also has a lot of other really interesting potential use cases that we're starting to explore with public blockchain technology,
voting and voter registration, tracking election results.
These kind of things are really, really great use cases for having that level of public transparency.
On public blockchains, there's another kind of transparency, which adds a lot of value as well, and that is full transparency into the smart contracts that execute on that blockchain.
These, oftentimes, are smart contracts which have the potential of working with other people's money,
sometimes large amounts of other people's money, and if you're going to entrust your hard-earned money into someone else's smart contract,
it's really nice to have the ability to be able to go and review the source code of that smart contract,
either yourself or by hiring a developer to audit that smart contract, to make sure it's written fair,
that there are no security vulnerabilities, and that it does what it claims to do.
On the private blockchain side, what we have [is] permissioning.
And we can control how open or closed our data is.
We still have a lot of benefits of being able to share data in shared infrastructure that private blockchain creates.
There are a lot of business networks and value chain relationships where the participants would love to be able to share more data
and more information with consumers about the business processes and the steps that go into delivering the goods and services we consume.
What has traditionally prevented solutions like this is the lack of any kind of shared infrastructure.
While technically conventional technology may be able to address these concerns,
it is oftentimes human beings not being able to come to consensus on questions of who owns the platform, who builds the platform, who maintains the platform.
And, if a participant leaves the ecosystem, do they take all or part of the platform with them.
That have prevented us from using conventional technology in these respects.
Using private blockchain solutions like Hyperledger, can help alleviate many of these concerns and create a truly shared technical infrastructure between organizations.
This allows participants in a supply chain or value chain to track data and to share that data about how goods and services are produced,
created, consumed, and distributed into the open market, that we haven't really been able to do practically before.
It's estimated that over 1/3 of the food we produce goes to waste, because we don't have this kind of clarity into our supply chain with food or into the supply chain with other types of products.
Think about if a meat gets recalled because it might be contaminated, how much perfectly good meat gets thrown away just to err on the side of caution.
Where if we just had greater resolution and visibility into where that product originated from and how it went all the way from production to our plate.
Then, we could issue more accurate recalls and reduce the amount of food waste.
Consumers might value your product more, your offering more, if they're able to see where it comes from.
If you're manufacturing and distributing clothing, and you can demonstrate to consumers that all of that clothing was
sourced from parts of the world with fair labor practices consumers are going to
have more trust and faith in the brand and ultimately willing to pay a higher price for it.
So, these kind of transparency solutions are one of the biggest benefits of blockchain and one of the areas being most explored,
because right now there are a lot of consumers who would simply like more visibility into the products and services they purchase.
And blockchain, both public and private, can be a great solution for doing that.

## Section 6 - Immutability

### Video 18 - Immutability

So, one of the big benefits of blockchain is what's known as immutability.
The idea that once a record gets committed to the blockchain or to the ledger, it's there permanently.
In blockchain, it's a little bit different than a database, and we'll talk about this in another module, in a lot more depth,
but in a traditional database we're used to being able to edit records and delete records, and that's not the case in a blockchain.
In a blockchain, there are only two possible operations: we can create a new record, and we can go back and we can read existing records.
And this contributes to this idea of immutability - once data is written to the blockchain it can't be edited, it can't be deleted.
All you can do is add another record to the blockchain indicating that something about that data has changed.
This immutability is what makes blockchain such a secure solution, and it's what makes it a trustless solution.
Meaning, I don't have to trust anybody that I'm interacting with and trading with, as long as we both trust in the blockchain and the data on the blockchain.
Then, we can transact back and forth seamlessly.
The way immutability works is blockchain is, by design, a very, very inefficient solution.
We are asking a large number of nodes, all the nodes on a network, to perform exactly the same work as every other node.
So, essentially, we are duplicating work over and over and over again.
The reason we do this, is because the only way to potentially change data on a blockchain,
is by changing the record on that blockchain for 51% or more of the nodes, or the miners, or the participants trying to come to consensus on the blockchain.
And when you get to very, very large-scale networks, Ethereum with its 16,000 plus nodes, Bitcoin with over 30,000 nodes, this becomes a very, very, very tall order.
Trying to hack or change a record on over 15,000 of those Bitcoin nodes would be quite a bit of work.
So, it's not impossible to change the record on a blockchain, but it is impossible from a practical standpoint.
Now, one thing that should be noted when we talk about immutability is: all that blockchain gives us is an accurate recording of what was posted.
It is still up to whoever is posting that information on the blockchain to make sure it's accurate and true.
In other words, blockchain doesn't do anything to validate that the information on it is correct.
All it validates is that that information hasn't been changed since it was originally written.
Another way to think about that is, I could post a record on blockchain that says: "The sky is orange".
That doesn't make the sky orange.
We all know the sky is blue. All that does is that means I can't ever come back later and claim I didn't say that or I said it was blue, and someone changed the record.
That immutability that blockchain gives us is that that data was captured as it was originally written and hasn't been changed.
Another part of this immutability is cryptographic hashing, and the way that we chain all these blocks together.
If you haven't watched the module on Proof of Work, I would suggest you go watch that now, to see a really in-depth overview, a hands-on demo of how blocks are actually linked together in such a way.
And, if I ever went back and tried to change any information or prior transaction on the blockchain, I would break that chaining in a very
obvious way that anyone would immediately spot if they came and querried that data off the blockchain.
So, when you hear about immutability, just understand that all we're talking about is the virtual impossibility of anyone ever being able to come along and change any data on the blockchain.
And also, along with that, understand that we only have two possible operations on blockchain: we can only read data and we can only add new data.
There's no concept of an edit or delete, and this is what we talk about when we talk about immutability on the blockchain.

### Video 19 - [Hashing and Chaining with Proof of Work](https://anders.com/blockchain)

In this video, we're going to talk about Proof of Work consensus, and how Proof of Work consensus is used to create an immutable chain of block data on the blockchain.
Let's take a small example. Let's say we have some block data and, in the interest of simplicity, we will keep this very, very short.
But understand that in real life a block will most likely contain many more than just three transactions.
But on this block, we have a full block consisting of three transactions.
When it's time to validate a full block, all nodes on the network will start to guess a nonce value.
What we're looking for is a nonce value such that when we take our input transaction data and we combine it with a nonce value, we get a hash output that matches the difficulty.
In this case, the difficulty is a hash output that begins with four leading zeros.
Every node on the network will guess a different nonce randomly until they happen to find one that matches the difficulty.
So, our node may start off by guessing "123", and we see that that does not produce a hash output that matches the difficulty of four leading zeros.
Let's try again. Let's try "973321". Once again, that does not give us a hash output that matches the desired difficulty.
[So], rather than guess over and over and over, let's go ahead and ask a computer to do our work for us.
The computer is now guessing different nonce values randomly until it happens to guess "22294", which you see produces a hash that begins with four leading zeros.
Because this hash is the output of input to a hash function consisting not only of the transaction data, but also of the nonce, changing either one will result in a new hash output which does not match the difficulty.
If I change "22294" to "22295", you'll see I get a hash output which no longer meets the difficulty criteria.
However, if I change any of my transaction data, I'm also altering the input to the hash function, and thus generating an output which is completely different from the desired outcome.
In this way, nodes or miners on a network can validate they have the same transaction data.
If we all start randomly guessing nonce values for this set of data and my node guesses "22294" first,
all it has to do is simply share this nonce value with every other node on the network.
Each node can then try this value "22294" on their copy of the transaction data.
If any of the data has been altered or changed in any way, no matter how insignificant, or the node in question simply did not record the data correctly, this nonce value will not work for them.
For example, if we change "4.2 bitcoin" to "4.9 bitcoin", you'll see that the proposed nonce does not work.
In this way, all nodes can come to consensus or agreement on what the right set of transaction data should be.
When a node thinks it's guessed the right nonce, it simply shares that value with the rest of the network.
If the majority of the network, 51% or more, agree with this nonce, because they have the same transaction data on their copy of the block,
then the miner who guessed this number first, will be rewarded and the network will come to consensus or agree that this is the correct version of the block data.
Any nodes which have different data for the current block will then discard the copy of the current block they have and replace it with a copy that the rest of the network has agreed upon.
This method is used to create blocks of data chained together.
So let's say, that we have some transaction data here on the blockchain.
We're gonna go ahead and mine our first block.
Now, you'll notice what we've added in this demo is the hash of the previous block, which is something we store in the header of every block on the blockchain.
Because this is the first block, I simply get a previous hash value of zero.
Combining zero with the current transaction data on the block and the proposed nonce gives me a hash that meets the output difficulty.
When it's time to validate the second block, the process repeats itself.
I simply take the hash of the previous block stored in the header of the current block, combine it with the transaction data in the current block, and try to guess the correct nonce.
In this case, it's "12314"
As discussed in our video on cryptographic hashing, changing any of the input data, no matter how slight, will result in an entirely different hash.
So, if I try and change "2.3" to "2.9", I no longer get an output which matches the current difficulty.
This new output is also reflected in the header of the next subsequent block.
If I have a series of blocks that have all been mined and linked together, then you can see that going and changing data on any block will break every subsequent block after it.
So, if I try to alter this record "David pays Charlie 2.3 bitcoin" and I want to change it to "5.3 bitcoin", I change the hash output of the current block.
This is reflected in the current block and also in the next block.
Now, the nonce proposed for the next block does not work when combined with that block's transaction data and with the hash of the previous block.
This means that if I want to alter data on the blockchain, not only do I need to remind the block that I changed the data on, I also need to remind every subsequent block in the blockchain.
This is no trivial task when you consider that major blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum contain millions of blocks.
And this process must be repeated on tens of thousands of nodes worldwide in a very short amount of time.
This ability to link together blocks in an immutable fashion and to cause attackers to have to undertake so much work, repeated so many times is what gives blockchain its security and immutability.
I hope you've learned a little bit more about Proof of Work consensus and how blocks on the blockchain are linked together through watching this video.

## Section 7 - Smart Contracts

### Video 20 - Smart Contracts

When we make a transaction on the blockchain, understand that there are only three types of transactions we can make.
It's what I refer to as the onion model of blockchain.
And we're gonna start off with a very outer layer of that onion.
The thing that most people are familiar with when they get into blockchain.
The thing we do all the time when we trade cryptocurrency back and forth.
That is two or more parties coming together and using the blockchain to record an announcement of the exchange of monetary value.
So, we might use blockchain to record the fact that I paid you three Bitcoin for your used car or I paid you twelve blockchain for your vacation home.
This is the model that many of us start off with in blockchain and again, it's the one that's most familiar and gets talked about the most right now.
But if we peel away that outer layer, and we take away the idea of a monetary transaction or exchange,
well, then we're left with two or more parties using blockchain to record an important announcement.
And we see many valid use cases around this. Let's say, that I go to the doctor for my annual physical.
My doctor checks me out and he says: "Hey Kris, I want to put you on a new prescription for XYZ".
Well, maybe we're keeping our medical information on the blockchain, and so my doctor and I both agree that's a pretty good thing to add to my medical record.
In this case, we still need two or more parties, because it's very important that I, as a patient, don't have the ability to go and update my own medical record without a licensed medical professional involved.
And it's also equally important that my doctor is not able to update my medical record without my consent or permission.
And so, that's two or more parties coming together, recording an important announcement or important data point,
but nowhere in that example has money or anything of monetary value exchanged hands.
Now, if we peel away the very last layer, you can take away this idea of having to have two or more parties.
And what we're left with is just a single party announcing an important or significant event.
And this is the simplest type of blockchain transaction, and also the most powerful.
So, if we think about blockchain, perhaps for managing a supply chain scenario,
we might have a grower of organic produce announce or commit a record to the blockchain that says they've planted a crop.
And we might have an organic pesticide company come and treat that organic produce.
We still have a single organization or single entity making the announcement of something they did, and this is really the heart of blockchain.
When you understand that it becomes really easy to understand where smart contracts fit in.
And smart contracts are just computer code. They're codified logic that we can use to respond to any kind of event that gets captured on the blockchain.
So, in that organic produce example, if I want to notify someone when that fresh produce has been treated with organic pesticide, so I can create traceability for the end consumer,
well, I might have a smart contract that manages that that defines the rules and the steps that get taken when that particular type of event occurs.
And so this is all smart contracts are.
There's oftentimes a misconception when people hear the word contract that they think of a legally binding agreement between two or more parties.
It's not necessarily the case. Smart contracts don't have to be legally binding and they don't have to involve multiple parties.
In fact, if you come from a programming or development background you can think of a smart contract easily enough as a "class".
If you're not a programmer or don't come from a developing background, you can just think of a smart contract as a set of rules that get executed every time a certain type of event happens.
And this is where the real power of blockchain comes in that not only do we have a permanent, unchangeable record of all the different events that have occurred,
we can also write computer code, very, very non-subjective computer code, that defines exactly how that process is going to be managed and what steps are going to be taken when that event occurs.
This allows us to ensure process consistency.
It allows us to ensure that processes that are normally fulfilled by intermediaries or middlemen can now be satisfied on their own without the need for human intervention.
And this leads to much more lean and efficient organizations in way of organizing human effort.
So, when you hear smart contract just think about computer code that you write to respond to certain types of significant events.
If you've ever worked with workflow or business process automation or management tools, you can think of smart contract is just being another workflow tool, albeit one that has the power to work with money.
So, don't get too intimidated when you hear smart contracts, and don't get too caught up in the language.
While they sometimes may be legally binding, they're not necessarily legally binding in the same way a true contract is.
They're just a way for us to bake our own logic into block chain solutions to ensure that consistency of execution.

## Section 8 - Blockchain Security

### Video 21 - Introduction to Blockchain Security vs. Standard Cyber Security

In this section, we're gonna talk a bit about how traditional cybersecurity is different than security concerns on the blockchain.
In traditional cybersecurity that we're all used to, we're very perimeter-focused meaning that we put trusted data and assets behind a very, very strict perimeter.
We assume that anybody we let inside that perimeter is trusted, either partially or fully, to see that data and access those resources.
And the brunt of our focus goes into making sure that we keep the right people from getting beyond that perimeter,
that we only let authorized users through, and then we prevent any attackers or strangers from breaching that perimeter and accessing the data and resources we store behind it.
This is very different from blockchain, which runs on a massively decentralized peer-to-peer global network.
Just by its very definition, you can see that there is no perimeter on blockchain, and so our security has to come from somewhere else.
Our security on blockchain comes from the incredible amount of repetition.
The fact that we ask every node to keep the same copy of the ledger and periodically to reach consensus, majority consensus, on what the proper data in that ledger should be.
This makes the amount of work that an attacker would have to do practically impossible, if they wanted to change, hack, or alter the ledger.
Another big difference between traditional cybersecurity and security on the blockchain is with conventional applications and conventional technology.
We either develop all our own code or application parameters in-house or we rely on a single, third-party trusted provider who creates that line of business system for us.
All the code, generally, comes from one place, and if we don't write it ourselves, all we have to have is trust and faith in the third-party organization providing it to us.
In blockchain, things are a little bit different, because oftentimes in blockchain solutions we're writing smart contracts which call code from other smart contracts, which we may or may not write ourselves.
And which may come from a variety of different authors.
So whereas in the traditional cybersecurity space, we really only need to rely on our own due diligence to write secure code or the due diligence of a third-party application provider.
In blockchain, we have to expend a lot more time and energy, making sure that the code and the contracts we're calling is safe and secure.
In other words, we want to make sure that we're not inheriting any security vulnerabilities from other smart contracts that have been written by unknown and potentially untrusted parties.
And the final big difference between conventional cybersecurity and blockchain is that in conventional line of business systems all of our applications either run directly on trusted hardware that we own
as an organization or run on hardware with a high degree of trust provided by a third-party such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.
In the blockchain world, all of our code runs on untrusted resources, untrusted hardware that can be owned by anyone, anywhere in the world.
This means that we must ensure that all the trust in a blockchain solution comes from the protocol and the code layer itself,
because it's a much more massively distributed network, and we don't have direct control or access into the hardware that supports it.
So, there are a lot of differences between conventional cybersecurity and security in the blockchain space that you're going to want to understand before you deploy your own blockchain solutions.

## Section 9 - Public and Permissioned Blockchains

### Video 22 - Public (Permissionless) Blockchains

When people get into blockchain, there's a natural discussion about what type of blockchain, because blockchain comes in many different types and flavors.
And normally, we hear about public versus private blockchains.
One factor that often gets left out is also the idea of an open versus closed blockchain.
And it's important to consider both parameters, so you know where on a possible solutions quadrant your idea falls.
When we talk about public and private, what we're really talking about is who is able to write data onto that blockchain or onto that immutable ledger.
The open versus closed brings in to consideration who's able to read that data.
And so, we can talk about solutions which are public and open, public and closed, private and open, private and  closed.
When we talk about public blockchains, what most folks are really talking about is a public open blockchain.
It's a blockchain where anybody can come write data to the blockchain, anybody else can come read that data.
So, public blockchain platforms like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin tend to get talked about a lot right now,
and these are what we also refer to as permissionless blockchain platforms meaning that they really strive to, by design, increase and protect the user's anonymity.
And, if we don't know who a user is, if we don't have a way of identifying individuals, and we don't have any way of creating permission or access rules around that user,
and it's what we get, is the system where anybody can commit data to that blockchain and anybody can come along and read data to that blockchain.
So, there's a perception that public blockchain platforms like Ethereum can't be used to build permission scenarios or to control access to data.
The truth is they can, they just don't give you the built-in tools that a private or permission blockchain platform will.
So, you can always use these open public platforms to build a permission solution,
but just understand that it's upon you, your architects, and your developers to create that permissioning model,
and that all starts with some kind of identity management system.
So, when you think of public blockchains, you think about blockchain platforms like Ethereum, understand, by default, by the very nature and design, they're designed to protect anonymity.
And, if we don't know who a user is, then we really have no way of creating permissions, role-based access and controlling what data they can read or write.
In a lot of situations, this is desirable, this is why we see cryptocurrencies based on public blockchain platforms, because having that anonymity is important.
And, if a user has a currency, something of value, they should be able to exchange it and spend it, and do what they want with it, just like anybody else.
We don't want to treat any class of users differently than any others in those scenarios.
So, that's a public blockchain, and that's a very different animal from the private permission blockchain.

### Video 23 - Private (Permissioned) Blockchains

So, the counterpart to a public blockchain is naturally a private blockchain.
These are platforms like Hyperledger or Hashgraph.
And private blockchains are more specifically known as permissioned blockchains.
When we talk about private blockchain or when you hear folks talking about private blockchain solutions, they tend to be talking about things on the private and closed end of the spectrum.
We want to control who can write data to this blockchain, and we want to control who can read data from this blockchain.
And in order to do that, the first step is identity.
If we don't know who a user is, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to define rules about what data they can commit to the ledger and what data they can consume from the ledger.
So, when we talk about private blockchain, just think about permission blockchain, the blockchain which right from the beginning is an idea of who you are.
And this is very different from a public platform like Ethereum, in which the platform tries to protect and maximize anonymity.
And we, by design, don't know who a user is, unless we build in that kind of identity management scheme.
Private blockchains tend to come with identity management tools or a modular architecture, where you can plug in your own identity management solution.
This can be anything from an Active Directory deployment to an OAuth solution using Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
Just understand the idea behind the private blockchain.
All begins with understanding who a user is, because once we understand who a user is,
we can determine what role they're in, and we can use that role to determine what information should they and should they not have access to.
This also changes the incentive for good behavior a little bit in a public blockchain, because we don't know who a user is.
We rely on economics and game theory incentives to ensure that everybody in the system behaves honestly and according to the rules.
We set up situations through group consensus, which we discuss in other sections in this course, through which honest participants are economically rewarded,
where dishonest ones only incur work or cost, with no possibility of ever recouping that cost.
In a private permission blockchain, we rely on the fact that we know who a user is.
So, in a corporate scenario, blockchain for the business, blockchain for supply value chains, because we know who an individual is, what organization they're associated with and what their role is,
we also assume that they're going to behave fairly aboveboard, because if not, we know exactly who's misbehaving and they know that they're gonna suffer the consequences for that.
So, public and private blockchains, two very, very different offerings.
A lot of people make the impression, get the impression that they compete with one another, when really they don't.
They just serve to provide different types of solutions and enable different kinds of products and offerings to be built on top of them.

### Video 24 - Public and Private Comparison

So now that we've talked about public and private blockchains, what those terms mean, and again, you can think of that as permission versus permissionless blockchains,
we can talk about some of the differences and what each different type of platform aims to provide.
So, public blockchains are really good for scenarios where protecting the anonymity of users is important or adds value to the solution,
and they're really great platforms for solutions where all users should be treated equally.
And we can see this, because most public blockchains right now are used to support cryptocurrencies, and this is a real great use case.
With a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc., we don't want to have any permissioning or role-based access.
Anybody should be able to own some Bitcoin.
Anybody should be able to trade it with anybody else, and it's not necessarily important that we know who the participants in any transaction are.
And so that leads to an open permissionless model with full transparency.
This is very different in the corporate world, where we see private blockchains being adopted at scale, because the concerns are the opposite.
In a corporate scenario, in a business scenario, anonymity is a bad thing.
I want to know exactly who all the participants are, and I need to know who they are, because I don't want full transparency.
I don't want to share all my business data with all the participants in my business network or the general public at large.
I want to control who sees what type of information under what circumstances, and I also want to control who is able to contribute that information onto the blockchain.
So, I might use a private blockchain solution to manage supplier-vendor relationships, where only myself and my suppliers can see the price that I'm paying for a certain item.
Only a particular supplier gets to see the details of the contract that I have with them, and not the details of a contract I have with any other suppliers.
And I may wish to share some of this high-level macro data with consumers, so that they can see the origins of the products they're buying, but of course I'd want to hide the financials behind all that.
So, when we look at how these two solution types differ, we see the public blockchains tend to focus more on B2C or business to consumer scenarios,
whereas private blockchain offerings like Hashgraph, Hyperledger, really lend themselves well to B2B scenarios, supply chain, value chain relationships
or creating any kind of shared infrastructure between enterprises.
So, just understand that, well, there's a big misconception that these are competing offerings.
They're really not and many real-world use cases use components of both.
It's important to understand the difference between them and it really all starts with identity management.
So, when you're thinking in your head about public versus private blockchain understand that it all begins with identity management,
and in a private blockchain I know who all the participants are right from the beginning.
In the public blockchain, again, I don't know who those participants are, and that's not to say that I can't build a permission solution on a public platform,
but myself, my architects, and my developers are gonna have to develop the logic and the mechanisms behind identity management.
So that's public and private blockchain. Two very, very different animals.
They serve vastly different purposes and as you start to dig into a lot of real-world use cases, what you're going to find is many use cases make use of both types of blockchain integrated seamlessly.

## Section 10 - Blockchain Flow

### Video 25 - Blockchain Transaction Flow

In this section, we'll discuss the blockchain transaction flow.
Regardless of the blockchain technology, the flow of data through a blockchain will remain relatively the same, at least at a high level.
It will all start with a blockchain user performing an operation that should be stored on the chain.
The operation will trigger a smart contract, or it will trigger chaincode.
In either case, the code will be executed on the actual blockchain itself.
The output of this code will result in a transaction, and that transaction is what we intend to be stored on the blockchain.
Next, the blockchain operators using protocols that will be specific to the specific blockchain that's running on will spread that transaction throughout the blockchain network.
The block creators will collect all of the transactions and it will create a new block.
In most blockchains, this is the job of the miner and is the output of the mining process.
The block operators will spread the block through the peer network to update the ledger copies once consensus has been achieved.
And this results in the block operators again executing code included in transactions within the block to update their own copy of the internal state of the blockchain.
The users will be notified of an event from a blockchain creation via an event.

### Video 26 - Consensus

So, one of the most important components to blockchain is this idea of group consensus.
As we talked about in an earlier module, blockchain is inherently a very inefficient system.
We're asking multiple nodes, sometimes tens of thousands of computer nodes, to all repeat the same work: they're all keeping a copy of the same data.
And the reason we agree to this tremendous inefficiency is because if we can get all or most of those nodes to agree on what the truth is.
We can have a lot of trust that that's actually the truth, that that record hasn't been tampered or altered or changed in any way.
So, consensus is one of the underpinnings of blockchain.
There are several different methods we use right now to have all these nodes reach consensus.
Essentially, when we talk about consensus, you can think of every block in a blockchain as being like a sheet of paper.
It's got a fixed amount of space. We write a transaction on every line, and when that sheet of paper is full,
it's important that we all, as a group, come together and compare our different sheets and select the sheet or the version of paper that the majority agree with.
And so, there are several different methods that we use to come to consensus on a block.
The oldest and most widespread method is what's called Proof of Work.
And you'll see in another module, we actually dive into Proof of Work hands-on, and show you live what Proof of Work looks like and how it actually works.
Proof of Work has served us well for the past nine, almost ten years, got its start in Bitcoin, and it's used in every major public and most private blockchain offerings.
But we're also starting to see some of the limitations of Proof of Work.
One of the big limitations behind Proof of Work right now is how big and how fast it can scale.
Currently on Proof of Work blockchains, we're able to process somewhere between 50 and 20 transactions worldwide per second,
which may sound like a lot until you realize that modern payment processing networks like Visa can scale up to over 70,000 transactions a second.
So, in order to compete with conventional technology, blockchain really needs to add a few more orders of magnitude to that transaction rate.
There are many proposed alternative consensus methods for how we might be able to reach that kind of scale.
There are things in production right now like Tangle which use a blockless solution,
and they're also new and emerging consensus methods like Proof of Stake, or Proof of Activity that we're currently examining to take the work out of Proof of Work.
We also have another module in this course where we talk about Proof of Stake, and then another one where we compare Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake.
So, if you're curious about any of the details of how these consensus mechanisms are actually implemented,
be sure to check out those modules.
But the takeaway point to understand is that, it's this consensus, it is this idea of asking all of these nodes, potentially tens of thousands of nodes,
to all repeat the same work and then periodically come together and agree on whatever the majority select the right version of the truth to be.
That gives blockchain that high level of trust and that makes it such a secure record store.

### Video 27 - Fault Tolerance

One of the things we've talked about extensively in this series is how inefficient and redundant blockchain is and that is by design.
That's what gives us immutability.
And another thing it gives us is an extreme level of fault tolerance.
At its heart, blockchain runs on a peer-to-peer network architecture in which every node is considered equal to every other node.
And unlike traditional client-server models, every node acts as both a client and a server.
And so, we continue this redundancy down at the network level, where we're asking all these nodes to perform the same work as all these other nodes.
Like any peer-to-peer system, we have an extremely high degree of fault tolerance.
In fact, if we have two or more nodes online in a blockchain system, we still have a working blockchain.
And when you think about that amazing fact given the scale of major public blockchains, you can see the inbuilt fault tolerance.
Let's look at Bitcoin for an example.
That's a blockchain that consists of over 30 thousand nodes coming to consensus on every block.
As long as we have two or more of those nodes online and able to communicate, we still have a working solution.
That gives us a tremendous margin for error, for nodes coming and going offline, for network transport issues,
and it makes blockchain really, really a great platform to use in environments with less than ideal networks and power infrastructure,
because we can have nodes come offline, go back online and when a node comes online after being offline for a while,
all it has to do is sync up, and get all the data that it missed while it's been offline from all of its peers,
and then it's right back online participating like all the rest.
This is very different from the centralized systems that blockchain aims to replace.
In a traditional client-server model, if that server is offline, those clients have no way of getting the data that they requested or performing the operations they'd like to perform.
This is not the case in blockchain.
And if we look back historically at other peer-to-peer solutions, solutions like Bittorrent or Napster, we've seen the tremendous difficulty that authorities have had taking some of these networks offline.
That is due to the fault tolerance you get from a peer-to-peer architecture.
In fact, we saw this recently during the Arab Spring, when the Egyptian government decided one night to shut down Internet access for the entire country.
Well, within 24 hours Egypt was back online and connected to the Internet through a network-sharing mechanism known as mesh networking,
which at its heart is just a peer-to-peer method for sharing Internet connectivity.
So, we know that peer-to-peer has a long history of providing extremely high fault tolerance and reliability,
and that's why we've chosen to build a platform like blockchain on top of it.
So, if you're looking for a solution platform that offers you that kind of incredible fault tolerance,
if you're looking to deploy a solution into areas with less than ideal infrastructure or under conditions where nodes may come online and go offline frequently,
then blockchain may be a really good platform to look at.

### Video 28 - Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

So, we've talked a lot in this course about Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake.
Proof of Work is the oldest and the original consensus protocol. It's coming up on its tenth anniversary; first one into production with Bitcoin back in 2009.
And as a consensus protocol, it served us very, very well.
There have been a number of hacks and exploits that have been committed against various smart contracts and solutions written on top of the blockchain.
But for almost a 10-year history with over half a trillion dollar market cap, no one's been able to successfully exploit Proof of Work itself,
which really shows the security and the reliability of the protocol.
However, there are some shortcomings and criticisms to Proof of Work that are now leading us to look at alternative consensus mechanisms, like Proof of Stake.
One of those is our transaction processing capability.
On a good day, Proof of Work is capable of processing anywhere between 10 and 20 transactions per second worldwide.
This may sound like a lot, but it still leaves us a wide gap to conventional processing powers,
that something like Visa's payment processing network which can scale up to over 70,000 transactions per second.
So, in order for blockchain to continue to be a successful solutions platform, we know that we're going to need to find other consensus mechanisms,
which allow us to scale up that transaction processing speed into a range where we start to compete with conventional technology.
There are also some other criticisms behind Proof of Work that are leading us to alternative methods, like Proof of Stake.
One of those is the idea of centralization.
As you know from this course, one of the key tenants of blockchain is the idea of decentralization,
that no one central authority, intermediary or participant, should ever have too much power or control in a blockchain network.
What we're seeing right now with Proof of Work is an arm's race,
where folks are competing with very various specialized pieces of equipment, specialized hardware, specialized mining rigs, in order to mine most efficiently.
And this can be done most efficiently in large data centers where electricity is cheap.
So, right now, almost 80% of the processing power behind the Bitcoin network resides in six major data centers in mainland China.
A lot of advocates and blockchain purists think that this is far too much centralization in one geopolitical region of the world.
So, one way we aim to change that is through Proof of Stake,
where we remove the work component of group consensus and we replace it with a very specialized form of gambling or wagering.
The idea of being that if we no longer require specialized hardware in order to come to consensus, we can allow anybody with any kind of device to participate in consensus.
That may be you at home with an old laptop or a friend with a smartphone, or a tablet, or an iPad, that sits on your nightstand most days and doesn't get used.
This allows for a much wider and more decentralized range of devices and potentially a much larger network size to participate in consensus.
So, speed and the idea of decentralization are big drivers behind the move to Proof of Stake.
And we're gonna see how well that works out.
We'll see Proof of Stake finally go live in Ethereum later this year (2018), certainly with more blockchains to follow if it becomes a successful consensus mechanism.
So, when you hear the debate these days about Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake, and you're trying to understand what do they mean and why are we looking at transitioning from one to the other,
understand that we're just trying to overcome some of those big limitations behind Proof of Work, the consensus mechanism that has served us so well to date.
We're trying to find consensus mechanisms that most importantly allow us to scale up,
to get our transaction processing power on par with conventional technology,
and we're also trying to remove some of the centralized aspects that we've seen form around Proof ofWork.
We talk about Proof of Work and Proof of Stake in much greater depth in other modules in this course.
So, if you're curious about the difference between them, how they work and what the actual implementation differences are,
be sure to check out those other modules.

## Section 13 - Identity and Anonymity on Blockchain

### Video 29 - Identity on the Blockchain

In this section, we're going to discuss identity on the blockchain.
Let's start by understanding why we even need to have an identity on the blockchain.
Centralized systems can be coerced by other forms of authority to shut down their network.
Let's take Napster for example.
Napster had a decentralized network architecture, but they maintained the centralized authority.
Therefore, the central authority could be attacked and, by taking out the central authority, could effectively control Napster.
This is because Napster relied on that mix of centralized control over a decentralized network.
This impacted identity because you need an identity to control.
Torrents on the other hand, they do not operate in the same fashion.
Torrents provide a decentralized network with decentralized authority.
This allows the nodes to manage identity differently.
It's also the reason why torrents are still being used today, in spite of the entertainment industry's best efforts to stop it.
Torrents remove the central authority.
So this begs the question "Why didn't point-to-point networks like torrents attain the same level of acclaim as blockchain?"
Because there's no guarantee that the nodes would do the right thing.
Nobody could guarantee that the nodes would cooperate with each other.
This leads to an extremely important question.
How do you incentivize the nodes on the network to follow the rules?
In a torrent system, anyone can download and share a file, but there's not a real incentive to be a good actor on the network.
What happens when people do something dishonorable on a torrent for instance, and stop seeding the files that ate up bandwidth or occupied space on their computers?
Instead of music going to the network or other files, what if it were money going through a point-to-point network, through a bank network, let's say?
Your transactions would never be processed reliably.
You couldn't trust that the processing was not messed up, either deliberately or accidentally.
Further, because of anonymity and the way that identity works in the blockchain, you wouldn't have a way to punish or reward the actors.
Blockchain solved this problem.
It perfectly incentivized how to create a decentralized self-contained network using crypto economics.
This differed from earlier point-to-point networks because it offered economic incentives to the nodes that followed the rules.
Nodes are given money for following the rules.
This money is in the form of cryptocurrency.
The nodes were punished for tampering with the system or with past transactions, or submitting a bad transaction.
This is why all public blockchains can operate without an authority.
It is also the reason why cryptocurrency is mandatory for a public blockchain, and not needed for a private blockchain.
Because you need a way to incentivize the actors on the network.
Consider how these rewards and these punishments work and how a system without a central authority can determine what is valid and what is invalid.
On the blockchain, identity is important.
You have to be able to prove that your assets actually belong to you.
Different blockchains they use different systems for tracking identity and identity information,
but most are based on the principles of public key cryptography.
Before we get into the details of how identity works on the blockchain, we need to discuss the basics of public key cryptography.
The security of a public key cryptography it's based on let's call them hard math problems.
So, by that, I mean a hard math problem is one where it's easy for someone to calculate it, but it's hard for someone to reverse that calculation.
Take multiplication, for example.
All things considered, multiplication is easy.
If you have a little bit of time, something to write with, you can pretty much multiply any two numbers and get the right answer.
A computer can do can do that even more quickly.
Factoring on the other hand, it's hard.
The best way to factor a large number is to try every possible factor until you find the right one.
Well, this approach works well if the number to be factored is small.
It quickly becomes virtually impossible with a sufficiently large factor.
Some public key cryptography algorithms are designed so that breaking the algorithm requires factoring very large, usually prime numbers.
Another hard math problem used in public key cryptography is based on exponents and logarithms.
Exponents are easy, since it's essentially multiplication, and logarithms are hard, since you're essentially factoring.
Most public key algorithms that use exponents use a type called modular exponents.
All this means is that when they're done calculating the exponent, they divide the result by a publicly-known value called the modulus, and they keep only the remainder.
RSA is a commonly known public key cryptography algorithm.
It's based on exponents and logarithms.
RSA uses the power law of exponents.
What this means is that, if you take a number, you raise that number to a power, and then raise the result to another power,
that you'll get the same result as if you simply multiply the two exponents together and then raise the base to the result.
An RSA user chooses two exponents so that any number raised to the product of the two exponents in a given modulus produces the original number.
One of these is called the public key and that public key is distributed freely,
while the other is the private key, which is intended to be kept secret.
If someone wants to send a private message to the user, they convert it to an integer using a publicly-known method.
They raise it to the power of the user's public exponent and they send the result to the user.
The user raises the received value to their private exponent producing the original message.
RSA is secure because an attacker must be able to calculate a logarithm to determine the secret message.
Since this takes guessing every possible value until the correct one is found,
RSA is designed to make the number of potential values so large that finding the right one is pretty close to impossible.
Another public key algorithm uses different math behind the scenes, but the basics are effectively the same.
A user creates a public key and the private key that can be used together for either encryption or signing, which we'll talk about later.
The algorithms are designed so that an authorized user only has to do the, quote, "easy calculations",
while an attacker has to perform the hard calculations,
and the algorithm is designed to make attacking so that the hard algorithms are close to impossible.
Public key cryptography is how identity is handled on the blockchain.
A user's address on the blockchain it's their public key.
This has several useful properties.
Users do not need to reveal their identity on the blockchain, but they can positively identify themselves,
since determining their private keys requires solving a quote, "hard problem".
Anyone can send a user an encrypted message, since they have easy access to their public key.
Users can verify the validity of their transactions using digital signatures.
You can think of a digital signature as the opposite of an encrypted message.
In RSA, anyone can send an encrypted message to a user by converting it to a number, raising it to their public exponent, and sending the result to them.
The user's public and private keys are designed so that the users can retrieve the original message by raising the received message to their private exponent.
RSA digital signatures involve the opposite process.
A user writes a message and raises a condensed form of the message to the power of their private exponent to create a signature,
then they publish that signature.
Their public key and their message are both published together.
Anyone can verify the signature using a simple three-step process,
condense the attached message using the same method as the message writer, the message originator,
raising that attached signature to the user's public key,
then verifying that the results of the previous two steps are identical.
Digital signatures work for the same reason that encryption works in RSA.
An attacker needs to know the user's private key to perform either operation,
and the algorithm is designed to make that process difficult or very close to impossible.
This means that identity on the blockchain boils down to the possession of a user's private key.
So, it is absolutely important that that private key be kept safe.
In Ethereum, a user's identity is managed using a public key or address,
and the user can use the corresponding private key to sign transactions and read encrypted messages that are sent to them.
In Hyperledger (Fabric) and Corda, identity is encoded in x.509 certificates, which include the user's public key.
In Corda, specifically, certificates can either be public, which means that they are published to the blockchain,
or confidential, meaning that they are only shared with the parties that the owner performs transactions with.

### Video 30 - Anonymity in the Blockchain

In this section, we'll discuss anonymity on the blockchain.
Privacy and anonymity on the blockchain are a crucial part of its success in some applications.
If individuals or organizations are performing transactions on the blockchain,
they may not wish this to be public knowledge.
Different blockchains have different levels of anonymity and privacy built into the protocol.
As discussed earlier, public key cryptography is at the center of maintaining identity on the blockchain.
It uses a pair of public and private keys to make encryption and digital signatures possible.
At this point, we need to take a look a bit more into the relationship between a user's keys and a user's actual identity.
The first thing to consider is that there is nothing about a public key that ties it to its corresponding private key.
We've said that a digital signature verifies that an owner of the corresponding private key created the signature, but that is all that it says.
Since private keys are secret, obviously it can't be possible for someone to determine a private key from a public key, at least it shouldn't.
If you know a user's private key, you can calculate the public one, but the reverse is not true.
The other thing to keep in mind is that private keys are just numbers, and can't be tied to a person's actual identity, their real-world identity.
Identity on the blockchain is just possession of the relevant private key,
and even if someone guesses or steals that private key, they can't learn its owner's actual identity from it directly.
The original blockchains did not have much in the way of privacy and anonymity protection.
You can't tie public keys to private keys or private keys to real-world identities,
which means that blockchain users have a limited amount of built-in privacy.
However, every transaction on the blockchain is public and stored there forever.
This means that a lot of information about the users' identity could be learned through sifting through the data stored on the blockchain to obtain the metadata.
Based on the repeated transactions to places like a coffee shop or a market, someone could get an idea of where an individual lives and their habits.
For businesses, repeated transactions may indicate business relationships that may lead to a loss of a competitive advantage if leaked.
On basic blockchains, anonymity only goes so far.
The limited level of anonymity and privacy protections available on the original blockchain has inspired development of enhancements that increase privacy,
while still allowing transactions to be verified and validated publicly on the blockchain.
This is an incomplete list of some of the mechanisms developed and implemented in various blockchains.
We'll start with zero knowledge proofs.
They use cryptography and cryptographic algorithms to allow a user to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the actual secret.
A common example of this type of proof includes a colorblind person and two objects identical except for the color.
The colorblind person shows one object to the prover, conceals both objects, and then shows one to the prover again.
The prover then says whether or not they are the same object.
Since the only way of determining this reliably is that the objects are different colors,
the prover can prove the difference in colors without revealing the color of either object.
Another approach is stealth addresses.
Stealth addresses involve using one-time addresses to perform transactions on the blockchain.
A stealth address is just a one-time address that makes it impossible to link a transaction to a known account.
What this does is prevents the data mining attacks on privacy that we discussed earlier.
We mentioned previously that transactions are digitally signed .
With ring signatures, all that can be determined from a transaction is that a member of a group signed it, but not the particular member.
The ability to see who is performing transactions with whom is dangerous to user privacy and anonymity.
Protocols like CoinJoin mix several transactions together, so that it is difficult to pair senders with recipients.
Confidential transactions take advantage of homomorphic encryption,
which makes it possible to perform mathematical operations on encrypted data.
This means that the data contained in a transaction can be hidden from the public, while still allowing the network to verify that the transaction is valid.
Now, let's discuss how different blockchains implement the various privacy and anonymity mechanisms available.
We start with the Ethereum.
Ethereum does not currently implement many real advanced options for privacy or and/or anonymity.
In the current version, user anonymity is limited to the fact that no one can tie a public key to a real-world identity.
This is intended to change in the future though, and the Ethereum roadmap currently includes laying the groundwork for implementing zero knowledge proof.
Hyperledger (Fabric) provides several options for privacy and anonymity.
At the lowest levels, users can achieve increased anonymity through channels which can further encrypt the data that's stored on the channel using keys only available to members of the channel.
At the next level, Hyperledger Fabric also allows users to perform private transactions.
In a private transaction, data is stored on the cloud, but the hash of the data is stored on the blockchain.
This allows users to use the blockchain to ensure data authenticity without storing the actual data publicly on the blockchain.
Finally, Hyperledger supports zero knowledge proof, where a prover can demonstrate possession of some data without revealing the data itself.
These different levels of privacy and anonymity protection gives users a higher degree of configurability on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
Finally, Corda allows users to perform transactions either as a party or an anonymous party on their blockchain.
An anonymous party has the same level of anonymity protection as a basic blockchain,
relying on the fact that public keys cannot be tied directly to real-world identities.
A party on the Corda blockchain reveals the real-world identity of the user which intentionally sacrifices anonymity for identity validation.

## Section 14 - Trust and Trustless

## Chapter Summary

Blockchain is a digital decentralized ledger.

Blockchains are important because they provide a safe and secure way for people to make any type of transaction without having to trust anyone.

Blocks in a blockchain can be thought of as a sheet of paper. Blocks, just like paper, can hold any type of data on them.

When blocks fill up with data, transactions are hashed into what is known as a Merkle tree. Merkle trees provide for an easy way to find any specific transaction in a blockchain.

A hash function is a one way function that takes any type of data and converts it into a unique character code. Merkle trees use hashing to convert every transaction in a block into a 20-digit character code known as the Merkle root. Hashes are also useful when comparing large amounts of data.

A block header is a hash of many things determined by the blockchain, but most frequently consists of the previous block header hash, the Merkle root of the current block, and the timestamp.

By including the previous block's header hash, blocks are “chained” together.

Chaining is important because blockchains are kept on millions of nodes across the network.

Chaining allows blockchains to easily check and see if any data was altered just by comparing the hash of the current header. If the hash is the same on every node, then the blockchain is the same. If the header hash is different in any way, then the different hash’s blockchain is updated to match the majority of blockchains. This is what makes blockchains fault tolerant and immutable.

Blockchains are fault tolerant because if any one node loses track, it will be updated to match the majority of nodes running the current blockchain.

Blockchains are immutable because the data on a block can never be changed or deleted.

Contrary to a traditional database, every transaction on a blockchain is made public, and everyone can write onto a blockchain. This requires users to be anonymous to avoid identities being tied to a specific transaction.

Anonymity is achieved through public key/private key cryptography. Your private key is for your eyes only. Your public key can be shared with the public. Your public key is the address you receive and send transactions from. To prove that your public key is associated with your private key, a digital signature is used. A digital signature uses math to show a relation to your public key from your private key, without revealing your private key.

Anonymity poses a problem when it comes to trust. How can we be 100 percent certain that anonymous users are being honest when adding transactions to a ledger that once added, cannot be changed or deleted. The answer is to validate every transaction before adding them to the chain. This problem of validation is often referred to as the byzantine general’s problem, and the solution is found with consensus algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. These consensus algorithms take advantage of the fact that the majority of users on a blockchain have a common interest to keep the blockchain honest. We will go further into some consensus methods in chapter 2.

Not all blockchains use anonymity however. Private blockchains allow for the use of permissions to control who can read and write onto a blockchain. Private blockchains often require trust, but are much more efficient due to the lack of need for a consensus algorithm like Proof of Stake. A private blockchain would be useful when you want an extra layer of transparency and higher level of security than a traditional database might be able to offer. 

# Chapter 2 - Governance and Consensus

## Section 1 - Standard vs. Blockchain Governance

### Video 31 - Governance Explained

Governance is anything that allows you to maintain, update, or recover a network.
And, why do you need to care about this?
Well, we know in the real world things go wrong.
We need to be able to recover from those issues or, for instance, we need to update our network or our lives. Right?
So, we have governance in terms of governments in the real world and governance also comes in different flavors in the blockchain world.
It comes in off-chain and on-chain, and my friend Dylan is gonna tell you all about that.
That's where I come into play. So, we have some papers here that I'm going to explain and show you.
First, we have a paper that's showing key terms. So, we have key terms and extra credit.
So, key terms, first is going to be on-chain, off-chain, and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP). This is the terms.
And extra credit is going to be liquid democracy, you can google this later, futarchy, which is that one,
DAOs which is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which we'll touch on another video, and the last one is quadratic voting.
All right, so key terms, let's jump into the analogy.
So, we have ourselves. An individual here we'll start on this side and go this way.
So an individual here, on the off-chain, this is what the "OFF" stands for, so we have off-chain, and what she's doing, she's submitting a proposal.
And imagine this is all in a Bitcoin analogy.
So, she submits the proposal and here's the pool of proposals.
So, in this pool of proposals these individuals are voting on the proposals here.
So, you see a check mark, a check mark, and an X.
So, you have the majority says this is ok, and the minority says it's not.
So, what we have is this proposal going through. So, this is the off-chain side and we're going to on-chain. Right?
So, we voted, we proposed. Now, we're gonna move on.
On-chain! So, "ON" is right here, right?
So, we're going this way.
On-chain. So, we have the proposal that's has been voted upon and proposed over here, right?
So, we're moving over, and then this is the network. So, we're taking that proposal or embedding it on the chain of the network.
So, going forward there's no human involvement. This proposal is executable and everything happens automatically without human interaction.
So, an example of this in the Bitcoin world is the block time.
So, a long, long time ago in a far-off world kind of like Star Wars, if you don't know what that means google it.
So, you have an example here, right? So, we have block time and then a long, long time ago in Bitcoin, they set it at ten minutes.
So, this block time automatically adjusts without human involvement. It's based off of what's happening within the network itself.
So, that's off-chain, this is on-chain, we've talked about the key terms, we talked about the extra credit, we talked a little bit about what governance is in the beginning.
We talked about why it's important in this world, in other worlds. And that's governance with us today.

## Section 2 - Consensus

### Video 32 - Proof of Work

Hello! So, we're gonna talk to you about what Proof of Work is, or PoW.
So, PoW is a consensus algorithm and what that means is it is created to bring trust in a trustless world.
It was actually originally created to solve email spam.
So, that's a top fact for you to go and have a little look at that on Google.
And cryptographers have been trying to solve this problem for a long, long time, where there is untrusted parties within a network, or in a space in life,
and you need to create some kind of trust in order to transact with them, or do something else with them as well.
And with Proof of Work, we have been able to do that.
First was Bitcoin, and now we have Proof of Work.
So let's get to the analogy, as well terms.
So, here we go. We have terms and we have the analogy, as well as process.
So, the terms are hash, nonce, miners, target, and difficulty... yeah. So, we'll get into that.
So here, we'll start with the analogy first.
So, you have a lock. And the lock has a combination. So, you go through the combinations and you try as much as possible to find the right combination,
but once you find the right combination, you realize that you can unlock the lock easily.
So taking that combination process and that verification process of this being unlocked, we'll apply that to the Bitcoin mining world.
So, let's go through the process. Here we have a miner. So I've mentioned miners over here. So, a miner is just basically a bunch of computers, computational chips trying to solve a mathematical problem.
And here we're gonna go down into the analogy right. So, what is that mathematical problem?
Well, here we go. In the mathematical problem there's three things that you want right: you want to take the nonce, you want to take the data, and you want to take the previous hash, and combine those together.
So, here we have a previous block. So, that's the past block, and this is the present block.
So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna take the previous hash from this block, you're gonna take the data from the current block,
and then you're going to take a nonce that you create yourself and you're gonna do that over, and over, and over,
and what you're going to change out of those three ingredients is the nonce here.
And what you're trying to do is you're trying to create a new hash from the three ingredients to actually reach the target hash, right?
So, the hash is basically a fingerprint, a digital fingerprint associated to these three items together, and what you want is, you want that fingerprint to be lower than the target hash that's been given from the network.
So, I've mentioned difficulty, right? So, the difficulty within the Bitcoin network is going to change consistently, based off of the miners that are mining for that solution.
So, if you can get the solution in less than 10 minutes or over 10 minutes, they're going to change the difficulty automatically, to make sure that that threshold isn't met on either end.
Yeah? Does that make sense? So we have a new hash, and we have a target hash.
So, here you can see that this new hash is higher, it's a bigger number than this target hash.
So, the goal as a miner is for you to get a lower number than the target hash,
and once you get that lower number, then you can go to the top of the mountain and say "Guys, listen! I did this! I did this!"
You did it! Check it out! I did it! Done! So what's an example of this for PoW?
Some examples of PoW are Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

### Video 33 - Proof of Stake

So, Proof of Stake is basically a lottery in a blockchain network where you need to have coins and then stake them in order to be in with the chance to go ahead and validate data.
Why do we need to be concerned about that?
Well, it's a bit more efficient, supposedly, and also more scalable.
So, where we have Proof of Stake, it's a little bit faster than Proof of Work.
Anyways, so today we're going to use an analogy of a bucket to explain what Proof of Stake is.
And then also, we're gonna talk about the terms and examples.
So, let's start with terms.
Terms. First, we have a validator, we have forging, we have stake, and we also have a pool.
So, when you think of Bitcoin, you think of miners mining.
And, when you think of Proof of Stake, or you think of Ethereum, think validators, forging. Right?
Validators. Forging.
So, we got the terms. We got the analogy.
So, let's go to the analogy, right? So here we have a bucket, right?
So, we have a blue bucket here. And in this bucket, we're gonna have... this is going to be labeled as our pool.
So the term here, pool, that's our validator pool.
So then, we have names we're putting in the bucket. And then those names can be seen as stake.
So stake is some sort of value you're putting in this bucket and that's giving you a better probability of being chosen to actually validate the transactions.
So in this pool, I've written pseudo-random.
So all these names or stake in this pool are gonna be chosen as pseudo-random.
And once they're chosen, then you, a validator, are given the opportunity to actually forge a block.
So what that means is, they're gonna give you the data of the transactions, and they're gonna give you the information, and then you're gonna basically put it into a block.
Once you put that into the block, you're validating the transactions.
And if you're a bad actor what happens is, and this is kind of a mechanism to prevent bad actors, is if you put in... if you validate an invalid transactions then you lose the money that you put into the pool.
Easy as that.
So, you lose the money and you're also labeled as incredible.
So, with that being said that's the analogy of Proof of Stake, right?
So we have stake, we have a pool, we have pseudo-random, we have validators, forging, etc.
So now examples, who's doing this.
So we have Straits, not sure how to pronounce that, we have Peercoin, we have NEO, and we have Ethereum, and I put "kind of", because it's partially Proof of Stake.

## Section 3 - Governance with Autonomy

### Video 34 - Governance With Autonomy: Driverless Cars

Let's discuss governance with autonomy.
Let's jump 20 to 25 years into the future and see where we've gotten with AI and autonomous drive.
Driverless cars have now evolved to the point where a company can own a fleet of autonomous vehicles all driving in a variety of directions, moving items as well as people.
But it's more than just that. Each car is pre-programmed with a set of guiding principles.
For example, don't hurt humans, reach X percentage of profits within the month, maintain a set percentage of holistic health, etc.
Consider the following scenario: A vehicle arrives to pick up a passenger for transport within a set time frame to take them to their scheduled meeting.
The passenger is running late and therefore decides to take advantage of the option to pay an extra fee for an expedited route.
Conceivable solutions to provide this options could include designating a lane on the highway for users paying the premium
or sending micropayments to other vehicles in exchange for adjusting their travels to create a clear path for the expedited vehicle.
Once the passenger has been delivered to the appropriate destination, the vehicle recognizes the need for maintenance after running an internal diagnostic.
After repairs are completed, the vehicle heads off to a charging station and then moves on to the next customer.
This can eventually be applied to blockchain governance.
More specifically, decentralized autonomous organizations.
This is a concept that quickly manifested itself after the Bitcoin white paper spread and people began to run through thought exercises.

### Video 35 - Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

We're gonna speak to you about what DAOs are.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.
So, DAOs. What are they?
In the centralized world, we have entities like this.
So, you'll have a board potentially in a company, then you might have a CEO, then you might have another layer which is a vice-president, then it goes down to managers, and then down to employees.
And... And then, they have poor interns like me. Oh, dear...
So, within that structure, you have a hierarchy, right?
And effectively what this has, it's centralized.
So, you always have power driven from the top potentially or in other aspects.
And in a DAO, that is distributed.
So, let's... To explain the DAO, let's just say it backwards.
It's an organization that's autonomous as well as decentralized. Done.
Or... I can explain more.
So, imagine we have an onion here, right?
So, in the very center we have smart contracts stacked up on top of each other.
And those smart contracts, they are kind of, you know, stacked as I mentioned.
And each one of those smart contracts are attached. So, think of it as a massive line of instructions for something to do, something else, and it's a really complex stack, right?
So, from that stack we have here, and then on the outer circle we have oracles mentioned here.
So those oracles are basically devices and things that interact with the outside world.
So, I'm reaching out, grabbing some outside world information that could potentially change such as the weather, such as the president, such as a sports game, such as whatever that changes...
I pull that information back in to the inner circle where the smart contracts are stacked, and then I incorporate that data into what those smart contracts say, just in case the execution has to change, right?
And on the outer circle, our people, here, or the real world, so that's where the information is getting pulled.
So that, in kind of a nutshell, that's what a DAO is.
So, Elliott, why does is matter?
Why do we care about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations?
Well, they're decentralized, so you have a lack of centralization through one party.
And then you also have less corruption, because we all know that corruption is quite prevalent in the centralized world.
And then, you have errors, right? So, within the errors you have to make sure that you deal with these in a fair or appropriate way, and DAOs do that.
Then, you also have efficiency, because they use smart contract technology. They enable you to autonomously make decisions as well as have the efficiency behind that.
So, that's why.
All right. Now, we're gonna talk about the problems with DAOs, because listen, they're not all that great, kind of great, not all that great.
So, problems we'll start with bugs. So, with any type of code or any type of software program, there's going to be bugs built-in, because we humans, code programs.
So we humans are faulty.
So there's gonna be bugs with them and that's something we need to work on and reduce.
The next is governance. So, with governance, basically, there are issues with on-chain governance and there are also issues with off-chain governance, because we all know that governance is a big problem.
Not within DAOs, but within the whole sphere of decentralized technology as well as outside and in the meat world.
And, with that being said, think of the flash crash. So, you have this autonomous organization and it's governing itself, right?
So, these flash crash algorithms, they flash crash quickly.
So, that kind of fallen backup, that could happen with the DAO, and has happened in the past.
The DAO.
And, another thing is system design or end points, to define even more.
And system design goes back to bugs, somewhat.
So, you're designing a system. And with that, there could be weaknesses for hackers to get into.
And, with any weakness, especially within the decentralized technology world, it's the endpoints, right?
So, it's the oracle that I explained over yonder.
So, these oracles that are reaching out to the world they could be a weakness, because someone could feed corrupt data into that oracle and feed that bad data into the smart contracts which everything falls apart.
Also, it's all the connections within the DAO. So, it's the smart contract connecting to the oracle, the oracle connecting to whatever centralized data source it's pulling from.
So those little connections and gateways and endpoints are weaknesses that hackers get into.
So, these are problems and these are things that we need to focus on.

## Chapter Summary

Many different consensus mechanisms are needed in a decentralized world where there are no middlemen and where trust has truly become decentralized with the trustless movement of value.

Consensus is a way to ensure the nodes on the network verify the transactions and agree with their order and existence on the ledger.

The most prominent consensus method is Proof of Work. Proof of Work is a process that has miners find a nonce or a number that is combined with the other data in the header. The nonce must change the header hash to be smaller than a specific number defined by the blockchain’s difficulty. A big issue with the Proof of Work consensus process is that it requires a lot of time and electricity to complete. The incentive for mining is often cryptocurrency.

Proof of Stake is the second most prominent consensus method. Proof of Stake has nodes put up a stake to be chosen as the next block creator. When a block is chosen, the creator will receive the transaction fees associated with that block. If a block winner attempts to add an invalid block, they lose their stake.

Proof of Stake solves many problems that Proof of Work has. One of these problems is the electricity requirement that is associated with miners finding a nonce.

There are many other consensus algorithms, including Proof of Capacity, and Proof of Burn.

Because blockchains are distributed, governance is usually not determined by a single point of authority. It is determined by the users. If the users like a change initiated, they have the option of using that change within their blockchain.

Consortium blockchains can determine who has governance in a blockchain. They can control who can write onto the blockchain and who has access to what data. Consortium blockchains have lower energy costs, and higher speed, but at the cost of requiring trust among users.

# Chapter 3 - Blockchain Problem Solving

## Section 1 - Immutability

### Video 36 - Immutability

Well, for instance, you might have Jane who has a passport, right?
And her passport number is set in stone or potentially set in a blockchain.
She's recorded that passport number on the blockchain and we know that blockchains are cryptographically secure because of the hashing mechanisms that are in place.
And what they need to do is send those transactions or the records off to other participants within the network and that's where you have a distributed ledger of Jane's passport number.
However, then you have evil Fred. We don't like evil Fred. Where evil Fred might create another chain and there's something called the Nakamoto consensus algorithm.
And, what that means is that the longest chain of records and data is known to be the true or real chain.
So, he might want to go and change Jane's passport number in block 2, say.
And he creates four blocks.
He then transports that and beams it up to the other participants in the network and they accept it as the true record.
And that means that Jane doesn't have a passport anymore.
However, it doesn't usually happen and it's quite hard to do a 51% attack, also known as a Sybil attack.
So what you have, is an immutable trail with Jane's passport number in the blockchain and then distributed out to other participants in the network.
So, key terms.
Governance of the immutability. So, is blockchain network actually immutable?
That all comes down to how good the governance structure is.
We know that blockchains are cryptographically secure.
So, that also ties in with how the data is hashed and linked to each other.
We spoke about CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
And then we also spoke about 51% attacks or Sybil attacks.

## Section 3 - Autonomy

### Video 37 - Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are a set of rules that live on a blockchain.
So, I'm gonna simplify that a little bit. With the smart contract... It's basically a dumb contract built by a human.
And they may become smart in the future, but we'll start with dumb for now.
And what it is, it's "IF", "THEN", "ELSE" statement.
So "IF" this happens "THEN" do this, "ELSE" do this.
And Ethereum is actually one of the first decentralized networks to build in this turing completeness.
And what that basically means is you have the "IF, THEN, ELSE" statement and it loops through itself until it achieves the official goal.
And what is looping, is that it loops and then it kind of changes the variable that goes into the "IF" place.
So, "IF" change, "IF" change, "IF" change, etc., looping through.
So with that, smart contracts aren't the smartest, but they're quite simple.
And my friend Elliott here, is going to explain some analogies to help you understand that.
Analogy one: a vending machine.
So, you might have a vending machine that is spitting out Bitcola, right?
And the person wants to go ahead and purchase that Bitcola.
They put their money into the vending machine and then the vending machine has a smart contract built into it that links to Bitcola's oracle,
which tells basically the company, Bitcola, how much stock is in the vending machine and whether or not to replenish it.
It needs that internal token to speak to each other and that's how a vending machine might be smart.
Or... You might have a car, where you're speeding, and effectively you might have a smart contract with your insurance company and they communicate between your car and the insurance company.
And if you are found to be speeding, not me, then you automatically get fined and the smart contract automatically pays the insurer or pays the government.
Number two. A little bit more interesting is farmer insurance in the developing world.
So, they might have a farmer that has a crop of potentially rice or other food.
And what happens is they have a smart contract between the insurance company and themselves.
And if, for instance, you have a catastrophe, the insurance company potentially can send out a drone or maybe as a person to check the field,
and they can establish automatically how much or what the proportion of the field is actually affected by the catastrophe, and automatically pay the farmer directly through a smart contract.
So with that, you have some key terms.
So, we spoke about the autonomy of the rules within a smart contract, we talked about the internal token that is required in order for the smart contract to speak to the oracles and other participants within the network.
Then you have oracles which make sure that the smart contract basically gives its smarts, because we know it's not quite smart.
And also we spoke about turing completeness. So, this is the "IF" this, "THEN" that statements.
And it allows the code to loop back on itself until it finds the right answer.

## Section 4 - Multi-Party Transactions

### Video 38 - Double Spend

We're talking about double spend. What is that?
So, double spend is basically when you take the same coin or token or some sort of value and spend it twice.
And we don't like that at all.
So, what happens when you double spend?
Double spend is where you might have a dollar or a Bitcoin or any other coin or currency.
And you want to spend that more than once.
So, you go ahead, and you might duplicate it.
We all know what happens with duplicated or fake money.
So, how does that actually work in a blockchain world?
Within a blockchain world, you'll have a wallet and that will hold all of your coins, tokens, and basically your currency.
That is also recorded on the blockchain, and effectively, all of the network understands and knows that you only have a hundred and ten coins or however many you do.
And that's why, we have a distributed ledger.
A ledger of all of the coins in existence and where they might be in terms of the addresses.
So that brings about a monetary policy.
We know what happens when things go wrong with monetary policy.
So, within that space, you have your wallets, you have the blockchain which records all of the transactions and all of the coins, and how they've been spent and when.
And that is then distributed, like we said.
So, within that, we have key terms, right?
So first of all, we have consensus, and all of the distributed ledger records are effectively kept in consensus
or, if you try to double spend that coin, the other participants within the network will effectively say no, that's not true, and overwrite your transaction or whatever you try to double spend.
Then, you also have created trust in a trustless world, and by that, you have a monetary policy.
So, a monetary policy to maintain how many coins are in existence, where they might be, and when they've been spent.
And then, you also have a linked ledger.
So, that's the distribution ledger that we spoke about as well.
And all of that brings about traceability.
So, we know exactly where coins are.
And we know when they've been spent and how many have been spent.

## Chapter SUmmary

Blockchain is an immutable ledger. Once a block has been added to the chain, the data in the block is permanent and cannot be altered or deleted.

This append-only ledger needs a way to verify valid transactions and delete invalid transactions before a block is added to the chain. 

Transactions cannot be validated and added chronologically, because that would allow for a double spend attack. Double spending occurs when an address rapidly initiates two transactions. One of these transactions could be invalid, but, because they are initiated at the same time, both transactions could be approved. To solve this, transactions are put into a pool of unverified transactions, then nodes add these unverified transactions to a block.

When a block is full, consensus occurs, which is a process that selects the owner of a new block to be added to the chain. When consensus is achieved, nodes then validate each transaction in the selected block by referencing transactions associated with an address. 

Transactions can also be added in the form of smart contracts. Smart contracts are business logic in the form of self-executing code that lives on the blockchain.
