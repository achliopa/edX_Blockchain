### Video 1 - What is Blockchain

There's a new technology that has the power to revolutionize how you, businesses, and the world interact!
You've probably heard of it: it's called Blockchain!
But what is it? How does it work? How does it affect you?
Hearing the word "blockchain" is comparable to hearing the word "internet" in the early 90s.
It seemed elusive, like something that wasn't going to impact your daily life.
But here we are, more than 20 years later. Think about how the Internet has transformed businesses, commerce, communication, even music and video.
And that's not even touching on how the Internet has affected you.
We all carry the Internet in our pocket.
We can transfer money at the touch of a button, check the weather, get directions, and even have food delivered to our door.
The next technology to have that kind of impact isn't some of the buzzwords you hear.
It's not big data. It's not artificial intelligence. It's not even social media.
It's BLOCKCHAIN!
Now, let's discuss the vast promise blockchain has for every business, every society, and for everyone listening today.
And let's begin with an example we are all familiar with.
When you attach a file, a Word document, an Excel sheet, a PDF to an email, you aren't sending an original.
You are actually sending the recipient a copy, and that's a great way to move information around.
But it's not so great when it comes to things like money, stocks and bonds, music, loyalty points, intellectual property, tickets to a game or concert.
Then, sending a copy is suddenly a very bad idea.
Let's look at an example.
If I send you tickets to a concert, it's important that I don't send you a copy.
You now own the original asset and I can no longer use or sell those tickets.
Similarly, if I send you $100, it's important that I still don't own the $100, or have the ability to send it to anyone else.
Both of these examples illustrate a double spend problem, and those can be eliminated with blockchain.
So now, in this exciting time in history, every kind of asset, from tickets, to money, to music, can be stored, moved, exchanged, and transacted without an intermediary.
People everywhere can transact peer-to-peer and trust each other by using collaboration and cryptography.
How did we get here, to this place of trust and collaboration?
It began when Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still unknown, released a white paper in 2008, introducing a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash known as Bitcoin.
It is here that blockchain technology made its debut.
Even today people believe Bitcoin and blockchain are one and the same.
They are not!
Bitcoin, another alternative currency,  utilize blockchain technology.
While an important one, Bitcoin is only one use case for blockchain.
Blockchain allows people to exchange assets and perform transactions without a third party.
Imagine a world where you don't need intermediaries.
While traditionally we have needed central authorities to trust one another and fulfill contracts,
blockchain makes it possible to have our peers guarantee that for us. But how?
Assets, like we've discussed, are no longer stored in a central place, but distributed across a global ledger, using the highest level of cryptography.
When a transaction is conducted, it's posted across tens of thousands of computers around the globe.
These transactions are recorded as blocks.
Let's imagine a sheet of paper that has 25 lines.
When a sheet is filled up with 25 transactions, the block is validated via group consensus.
Once the page has been validated, it is added to a stack of previously validated sheets.
Each sheet on the stack can be assumed to be trustworthy because, once a sheet is validated, it can't be changed.
Because at this point, all the sheets are linked together.
And to link our sheets together, we embed information from the previous sheet of paper into the new, recently validated sheet.
In blockchain, our sheet of paper is equal to a block.
The act of embedding a previous block of information into the current block of information is called chaining, hence, the name blockchain.
In order to compromise or hack a blockchain network, someone would have to gain control of the majority of computers in that network.
This is extremely difficult to do.
There is no longer a single point of failure, and this is what makes blockchain infinitely more secure than what we have today.
Blockchain isn't just for assets, though. It extends to contracts.
These are called Smart Contracts.
And what are they exactly? What they sound like.
A smart contract self-executes and handles enforcement, the management, and performance of agreements between people.
Examples of smart contracts include insurance policies, copyrighted content, escrow and lending, wills, and trusts.
Smart contracts will revolutionize how we do business.
There are so many possibilities with blockchain; not just in the now, but with things we haven't begun to think about yet.

## Section 2 - Basics of Blockchain

### Video 2 - Blockchain - Let's Cover the Basics

In this section, we're gonna talk about what blockchain is: a real simple introduction to the basic concepts and principles behind blockchain.
When you hear about blockchain, you probably think of new, high-emerging tech.
Well, really, all blockchain is, is a combination of technologies that have existed for a long time.
They're simply combined in a new and creative way to give us an amazing new platform on which we can start to build solutions.
Blockchains are often referred to as digital decentralized ledgers.
And when you think of that, all you can think of is something we're all familiar with: a simple notebook.
When we talk about blocks and blockchain, all we're really talking about is a page of data.
We fill up this page with any kind of data imaginable, and, while most of the time today, we're talking about recording financial transactions on this page, or this ledger, or this block,
we can record any kind of data we want.
In fact, you can think of a block as being exactly like this piece of paper, in that the paper doesn't know or care what kind of information you're recording on it.
And just like the paper doesn't know or care, neither does the block in a blockchain.
So, while most of what we're recording today are financial transactions, we could also record things like voting records and results, land titling, medical records, or even the opening notes to a Beethoven symphony.
What makes this blockchain notebook incredibly powerful is that all the pages are linked together.
So that if I go back and try and change any data on any page anywhere in this notebook, I break a link in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way.
This gives blockchain a key property known as immutability.
And it's what gives blockchain the security that we've come to know and depend on.
Blockchains also give us an incredible technology called smart contracts,
which allow us to programmatically define the rules and steps that should be performed any time a certain type of event is recorded in our blockchain or in our magic notebook.
So, when you think about blockchain, don't get intimidated thinking it's something high tech, and new, and cutting-edge.
It's simply a new and creative way of combining old ideas together to give us an incredible new solutions platform.
And the rest of this series will take a deeper dive into these basic concepts and principles,
but if the idea of this unchangeable linked notebook makes sense, congratulations!
You already understand all the major principles and concepts required to understand what blockchain is and why it's so powerful.

### Video 3 - Introduction to Blockchain Components

* In this section, we're going to discuss the core components of the blockchain, starting with a high-level view of the blockchain components.
The first blockchain component that we're going to look at it's the ledger.
However, before we discuss the ledger, let's discuss briefly the history of the ledger.
The story of blockchain is tightly coupled with the story of accounting.
Historically, humans started off with no way to prove ownership and we began with a single entry accounting system.
The single entry accounting system for the first time in human history allowed us to prove ownership of the asset.
The ledger was associated with an owner.
The single entry accounting worked for centuries.
The issue with single entry accounting is that it mandated that there was a single authority, which is the reason why there was the necessity for a king or a queen to control the ledger.
In order to have trade, right, at the international level, we needed to have at least two authorities.
So, for instance, for England to do trade with France, we had the owner of the ledger, the single entry ledger, in England for instance, doing trade with the king or queen of France, who also had their ledger.
And so, we needed a new form of accounting, and that's where double entry accounting came in, which was in use up until very recently, now, within the last 40 years.
What blockchain is? Blockchain is the very first implementation of triple entry accounting, where we have an asset being recorded on the ledger in the context of a transaction.
The third entry and triple entry accounting is cryptography, where we have a cryptographic account of the transaction stored permanently and immutably on the ledger.
That's what the ledger is. A ledger is a collection of transactions.
It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction.
In blockchain, the differentiator is that no one owns the ledger, or all of the participants own the ledger.
The ledger is distributed. It is, in other words, it's decentralized. So, there's a copy of the ledger that exists on every node that exists on the network.
Said simply, the ledger is a distributed immutable record of a collection of transactions.
Bitcoin is the most popular asset.
It was the first asset to be recorded as a transaction on a blockchain ledger, and it remains the most popular, at least in terms of market share.
That's what the ledger is.
As we move to more modern blockchains, we start to look at blockchains such as Ethereum, which not only records the asset on the blockchain,
Ethereum and other public blockchains like Ethereum, they also allow you to have a permanent and immutable collection of code, also known as a smart contract, that runs on the blockchain.
So, the ledger stores the assets, the transactions that are on the blockchain, and it also holds the code.
The code that's stored on the blockchain is a smart contract.
Again, a smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain.
The blockchain is a network.
The blockchain is a ... A public blockchain is equivalent to the Internet, complete with the its own set of protocols, etc.
Private blockchains are more synonymous with an intranet.
It is... just like we have a use case for public blockchains and public internet, we also have use cases for private blockchains and an intranet, if we're gonna stay with that analogy.
On each of these networks there are nodes. The nodes are going to be synonymous with the computers that make up the network.
On the nodes, they are put together by a collection of protocols.
Each blockchain has its own set of protocols that defines not only the nodes, but how those nodes communicate with each other.
So, when you hear the term "peer network", that's what we're talking about;
we're talking about how that blockchain is put together, what are the protocols that define the peers, and how those peers interact.
Those peer networks, they store the ledger, they provide the updates, they effectively, they maintain the ledger.
That's what a peer is on a peer network.
On a public blockchain, it's public, and, by definition, that means that anyone is allowed to join and participate in that public blockchain.
On the private blockchain, however, the situation is a little different.
On the private blockchain, we have to control who can access your network.
Just like no company would allow... no company would allow anyone to access their private intranet,
in a private blockchain you have to be asked to join, or you have to have permission to join.
So, a membership service is a gateway that allows users and components to enter a private blockchain.
So, a membership service or a membership service provider provides the services of user authentication,
user authorization, component authentication, component authorization, more specifically Identity Management.
If we're talking about a private blockchain, then we have to control who the members are, and not only the members.
We have to also control the nodes that access the blockchain.
So, as we're talking about membership, one of the key components of membership is we have to allow certain users to access the blockchain.
In order to do that, we have to have a definitive identity for each user.
In the blockchain, that's achieved in two ways.
One, we use PKI, to provide a public key. And that public key represents the identity of the user.
But we also need a private key that each user can hold to prove their identity.
That private key is stored in a wallet. And a wallet is a collection of the user credentials. It is effectively ... it encapsulates private keys.
Additionally, in the blockchain... blockchains are self-contained, or they should be self-contained.
And so, one of the key aspects for developing on a blockchain or using a blockchain is we have to have a way to interact with the blockchain.
And one of the ways that we do that is through events.
So, when something occurs on the blockchain, either public blockchains... most public blockchains anyway, and certainly all private blockchains,
they have events that are fired when certain key actions are triggered.
This allows end-users, other systems, other users, different components to be able to act off of the events that come from an update on a blockchain.

### Video 4 - Who Is Using Blockchain?

There are a lot of really interesting use cases being explored with blockchain right now.
When you first get into blockchain, one of the areas you'll see people immediately jump to are healthcare, how can we manage our personal health information on the blockchain, and voting an election reform,
and both of these are really, really interesting ideas.
The goal behind the folks looking at blockchain for healthcare is the idea that it would be great if your medical records could be accessible with your permission to anyone else, anywhere on the planet.
So, if you're halfway across the world on vacation and you fall ill and end up in a hospital, wouldn't it be great if the doctor treating you had full insight into your medical records,
knew any allergies you had, or knew any prescriptions that you were already on?
So, that's a very, very big area, and this ties a lot into blockchain and Identity Management.
How do we safely identify and protect people's personal data on blockchain?
So, a lot of interesting challenges there that are being worked out...
Blockchain for voting and election reform is a big topic right now,
especially with all the conversation lately about how do we ensure the integrity of elections and demonstrate that our results haven't been tampered with or altered.
This is an area where blockchain could add a lot of value.
And then, of course, we hear a lot about traditional use cases, areas that are getting a lot of traction in blockchain right now.
Probably one of the biggest are supply chain, value chain relationships, which are very, very common in today's economy.
We have very, very few products or services that are offered completely and solely by one organization, without the involvement of other vendors, partners, suppliers, manufacturers, third-party organizations, etc.
So, blockchain to track the supply, the origin of the goods and services that we consume is a big use case.
Walmart is really pioneering this right now with a blockchain solution that they're using to identify the provenance of meat,
where does the meat that is sold in a Walmart store come from, and the ultimate goal here is that, when we do have contaminated foods, and we have to issue a recall,
currently, because we just don't have good insight into that supply chain, we recall and destroy a lot more food than we really need to,
which is tremendously wasteful, especially with all the people on the planet that we could be giving that good food to.
So, these are some real, real exciting areas that we see being pursued in blockchain right now.
On the public sector, there's a lot of interest in blockchain for law enforcement purposes.
How do we allow different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, county, city level, all to share data seamlessly, in a safe, secure fashion,
which also protects people's personal privacy and anonymity, when appropriate.
Another area where blockchain is getting explored and is generating a lot of excitement is with artists, with people who produce content.
So, if you're an author, if you're a musician, if you're an artist,
traditionally, you've only been able to get your work out to the public, in the hands of the public, by going through a third-party intermediary.
So, if I'm an author, traditionally, the only way I've been able to share my creation with the general public has been going to a publishing company and getting my works published.
Blockchain enables lots of interesting scenarios where I can sell that work directly to consumers, create new subscription models,
and this is having very interesting effects on the work itself.
One of the things we're seeing is that traditional book publishing, there's anywhere between 12 to 18 months delay between when the author finishes the last word of a book and when it actually ends up into the consumers hands.
Well, if we can use blockchain to enable consumers to purchase this material or subscribe directly to the content creator, we take that lag time completely out of it.
And this allows authors and content creators to do some really interesting things.
You could write a fictional story and have one of your characters respond real-time to a news story that actually happened last week.
It makes for very compelling reading and it's just something we're not able to do today in the traditional publishing world because of that delay.
We also see a lot of interest in blockchain for fractional asset ownership scenarios.
So, we know we're 10-15 years away from having self-driving cars be a very regular thing, and when we all get our own self-driving car, if we're smart,
we're gonna have that car take us to work and then turn around and perform ride-sharing services throughout the day, when we're not using it, in order to recoup some of that investment.
Well, in a blockchain world with coins and tokens, we can fractionalize that asset ownership,
and I can take that same money I used to buy one self-driving car which operates in one city,
and I could buy one percent of a hundred self-driving cars in the hundred's biggest cities on the planet.
And so, if they're ever weather conditions, where maybe my car couldn't operate locally, that's okay.
I have a much more diversified investment, which continues to offer returns,
because I have a virtual guarantee that any major city that I have one percent of my car ownership in is currently in rush-hour right now, in peak times of people needing a ride.
So, there are lots of very very interesting use cases for blockchain in the real world right now.
I would encourage all of you to dig in a little bit more,
and see some of the interesting things that are going on with blockchain in healthcare, in public sector, in insurance, in supply chain, value chain and more,
see what other folks are doing, and then go out and make your own blockchain dreams a reality.

### Video 5 - Dubai Use Case

So, when people first start getting into blockchain, one of the areas they really start to look at is where is blockchain being used in the real world,
what examples do we have of a blockchain being deployed and at what scale.
And there's really no better example of this right now than what's going on in Dubai.
Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is piloting a very ambitious program called smart Dubai 2021.
And what Smart Dubai 2021 aims to do is to move all governmental operations and record-keeping on the blockchain by the year 2021.
The goals of this program are increased transparency in the government operations, increased efficiency,
and by proxy, providing better service to city residents and constituents and establishing Dubai as a thought leader, an industry leader in the blockchain space.
There are lots of really cool applications that tie into this.
Blockchain is becoming the enabling layer for a lot of other Smart Dubai initiatives around creating a smart city.
So, projects like automated traffic signals, registration of citizens for governmental services, etc. are all being pioneered on blockchain.
So, if you want to see some of the really exciting use cases in blockchain right now, be sure to check out Dubai and what's going on with their Smart Dubai 2021 initiative.

### Video 6 - Island of Yap

The concept of distributed ledge's has been around for hundreds of years.
To understand the basics of blockchain, it's important to understand how distributed ledgers work.
A distributed ledger is a collection of data with no central administrator that has been agreed upon by consensus.
To understand more details, let's take a trip way back, back into 500 AD on the island of Yap.
The Yapese people used a very unique form of currency: the Rai stone.
Each of these stones weighed around 200 kilos, making them difficult to move.
To exchange them as money for goods or services, they divided the stones into sections and then, they would announce to every adult on the island who owned what part of each stone.
Each adult had to keep a mental ledger of ownership.
Every time any Yapese conducted a trade, an announcement was made to the entire tribe.
Each member of the tribe would then update their mental ledger.
In today's description, this would be called a distributed ledger.
All Rai stone ownership was known to everyone, and that knowledge was updated whenever a transaction was made.
So why didn't just one member of the tribe keep track of the Rai stones?
What if that main recordkeeper was sick, unable to do their job, or was found to be dishonest?
If the only copy of the ledger was changed by any means, wealth would be lost or gained unfairly.
The Yapese knew their distributed ledger system safeguarded it from tampering.
Since all the Yapese knew who owned what, it would be very difficult to fool everyone on the island.
Even if one tribe member moved away, the tribe still had multiple copies of their mental ledger.
In this regard, the ledger was fault tolerant and could not be easily changed, corrupted, or lost.
The tribe also decided that stones didn't have to be on the island to hold value.
One day, a stone fell into the ocean and the Yapese decided that this stone, even though it could not be seen, still held value and could still be traded.
This system of consensus by the majority of the adults on the island with no central administrator is one of the first examples of distributed ledger.
